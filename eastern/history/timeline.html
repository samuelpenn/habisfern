<h1>Brief Timeline of the East</h1>

<h2>The Coming of the Ice</h2>

<p>
As the Ice flowed down out of the Spines of Ice, east and west were effectively
cut off from each other. From the north, the unstoppable advance of the Ice
wiped all trace of human civilisation out of its path.
</p>

<p>
Leading the advance of the Ice were those creatures in thrall to it - the giants
led by Snaw, the spirits and wraiths together with their posessed, and the inhuman
men who had fallen under the domination of the North. Weakened by famine, and
plagued by disease, mankind was no match for these foes, and the brief and terrible
wars which preceeded the Ice's advance caused untold loss of life and suffering.
</p>

<p>
The survivors flee southward, to the warm grasslands still unaffected by the
encroaching cold. There though they find only war again, this time between the
city states of men.
</p>

<p>
Out of the chaos is born Yorael, son of Hraldin, who is gifted with the voice
of leadership and a mind crafted for war. Rising to become King of Urbrannen,
he subjugates the nations around him, until a peace of sorts is reached. Taking
an army northwards, he comes to the Castle of Snaw, built on the Ice a league
above the buried city of Ubra. There, Snaw is defeated, and the god Rorth is
freed from the clutches of the Ice.
</p>

<h2>After the Ice</h2>

<p>
Defeated, and lacking leadership, the forces of the Ice fall to bickering, and
halt their advance southward. As the Ice slowly begins its march back Northwards,
so the city of Urbrannen.
</p>

<h3>1</h3>
<p>
Yorael becomes King of Urbrannen. Formation of a new, stable, human kingdom
based at Urbrannen. The defeat of Snaw, and the beginnings of the retreat of
the Ice.
</p>

<h3>200</h3>
<p>
The priests of Hraldin take control of the Kingdom of Urbrannen, forming the
Hraldic Theocracy. All other gods are outlawed.
</p>

<h3>1000</h3>
<p>
The Ice retreats up into the Spines of Ice, clearing all lands south of this
range of mountains. Northern plains are still glaciated, though the Ice is
rapidly retreating. The plains around Urbrannen are becoming marshy, and to
the far east, swampland is becoming common.
