                Habisfern is a fantasy campaign world. It is low fantasy,
                with realistic ecologies, histories and societies. Magic
                exists, and is relatively common, but low powered.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The purpose of this encyclopedia is to describe all facets
                of this world, in an easily accessible form. It is currently
                limited in the number of entries, but is growing as older
                documents are converted into the encyclopedia format.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It is currently very much a work in progress. Most of the
                pages here are auto generated, so expect the format of
                the encyclopedia to change radically at any time as the
                technology behind the pages is updated and modified.
