                Midlaen, or the Middle Lands, are a region once claimed by
                the Kingdom of Weidany, but which have since obtained
                independence. In truth, the region is so lightly
                populated that governing it was never really a reality,
                and the brief war of independence in 1193 was not much
                more than the sacking of a few royal guardhouses and a
                refusal to pay taxes, neither of which were punished.

                Midlaen is similar to Weidany in culture, though its
                people are fiercely independent, and distrust any form
                of government from a far. Small lords and individual
                land owners can be found throughout the countryside,
                but there is little communication or cooperation
                between them.

            <para>
                The only town of sizable note is Blackbay on the only
                stretch of coast which isn't covered with thick
                unexplored woodlands. Most trade comes through Blackbay,
                and it has a reputation for being a haven of pirates.
                The only reason it isn't also a haven for smugglers is
                that there are no customs laws or taxes that need
                evading.
