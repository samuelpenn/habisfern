            <para>
                Orm the Proud was the jarl of Erding Island up until 
                1223. He was a noted warrior, sailor and viking of the 
                region, generous and brave. He was lost on a whaling 
                expedition together with his crew, and his brother 
                Ornrick took his place.
            </para>

            <para>
                Three months later all contact with the island was lost. 
                Trade ceased, and ships sent to Erding never returned. A 
                few people did make it out, and told tales of horror and 
                darkness, of the  living dead terrorising the land.
            </para>

            <para>
                In the years since, the most consistent stories tell 
                that the Black Swan returned crewed by the dead, and 
                that the dead jarl slew his brother and most of his supporters.
            </para>

            <para>
                Since then the dead have had control of the island, 
                under the rule of Orm the Proud, now sometimes called 
                Orm the Dead. He has ordered the construction of a grand 
                hall, the work being performed by living slaves.
