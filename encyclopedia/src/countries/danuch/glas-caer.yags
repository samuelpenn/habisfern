            <para>
                The border between <qv uri="tanwall">Tanwall</qv>
                and <qv uri="canuch">Canuch</qv> is defined by the
                ridge of hills known as Doraida. The hills run
                south of Canuch along the western border of
                <qv uri="danuch">Danuch</qv>, and here they are
                called Glas Caer, the Grey Wall.
            </para>

            <para>
                A mixture of heathland and rocky foothills, they are
                often shrouded in mist, especially in the early 
                morning. Though the northern hills are home to
                Wyrvern and similar beasts, Glas Caer is noted for
                a very different form of danger.
            </para>

            <para>
                Powers walk the hills of Glas Caer, Powers which
                are affiliated with the <qv uri="ice">Ice</qv>.
                They are nameless, and thought bound to stay near
                ancient sites of Elder construction. Those who
                die in the hills though are commanded to rise and
                do the bidding of these Powers. The dead keep to
                the hills, stalking travellers who try to cross
                their domain. It is thought that they protect
                some ancient artifact of great importance to the
                Ice, but no-one has found out what it is.
            </para>

            <para>
                The Ice claimed dead are commanded by the Bright 
                Lords, ancient heroes who have themselves been
                claimed by the Ice. They wear armour of silver
                and white cloaks, carrying shining swords or
                spears. They are beautiful and terrible in
                their perfection, everything that is to be
                expected from a servent of the Ice.
