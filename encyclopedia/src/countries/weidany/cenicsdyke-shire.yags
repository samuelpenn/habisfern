            <title>The Shire of Cenicsdyke</title>
                        
            <para>
                Cenicsdyke is the newest of the shires, having been
                officially named only in 1207. Its lands were awarded to
                the <qv uri="cenic-house">House of Cenic</qv>, which was
                created at the same time to protect the border of the
                Kingdom from <qv uri="nailand">Nailand</qv>.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The shire's two major towns are the castle of
                <qv uri="fenborough">Fenborough</qv> and the keep of
                <qv uri="denithborough">Denithborough</qv>, both heavily
                fortified and designed as bases against the short folk.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The military might of Cenicsdyke is strong numerically,
                but the shire lacks the political stability necessary to
                form a unified front for defence.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The eastern borders of the shire are marked by a great
                earthern wall which is still not fully constructed.
                Manning the wall is turning out to be a huge financial
                headache for the shire.
