            <para>
                Heath castle was originally built in the sixth century, 
                though has been rebuilt many times in the intervening 
                centuries. The current castle is a sprawling stone 
                construction along the western edge of the original hill fort.

            <para>
                The town that has grown up around it is tightly packed 
                onto the hill top. The streets are narrow, twisted and 
                generally short. There used to be a stone wall which 
                surrounded the town, but this was outgrown a couple of 
                centuries back, and is now in a state of disrepair.
