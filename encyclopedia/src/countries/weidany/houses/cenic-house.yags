            <title>House of Cenic</title>

            <para>
                 This is the youngest of the Houses, formed only in 1207
                 when the thegn Cenic was awarded land of the new shire
                 of Cenicsdyke after its namesake led several very
                 successful campaigns against the invading short folk.

            <para>
                Since less than a generation has passed since its
                formation, there is still a great deal of jockeying for
                power within the family ranks.

                                Character belongs to the House of Cenic.
                                This is a minor noble house, but nevertheless
                                affords the character some respect and status.
