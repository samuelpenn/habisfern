                Town in the <qv uri="angsly-shire">Shire of Angsly</qv>,
                which was the site of a major peace settlement between the
                kingdoms of Angsly, Perrin and Merrik in 761. A great hall
                was built for the kings of the three kingdoms to meet in
                each year, and the town became central to the politics of
                the region.
            </para>

            <para>
                The hall is still there (well, a version of it), and now
                Holbury is an important trading town, obtain much recenue
                from taxing barges on the river Langly.
