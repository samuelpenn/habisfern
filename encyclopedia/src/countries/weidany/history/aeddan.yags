            <title>Aeddan</title>

            <para>
                Aeddan was a hero of the Weidanic nations who fought against
                the Rornic invaders and who won many battles during the 6th
                and 7th centuries. The date of his death is often given as
                618, when he dies leading a charge against the shield walls
                of the Rornic.
            </para>

            <para>
                Aeddan has the aid of the Druids, and also their Elder
                masters. His parents were brother and sister - Bradwen
                and Dwynwen. He was a warrior and she a prophetess, who
                foresaw that her child would be a great hero for her
                people, and her brother's child would bring the defeat
                of her people. She thought she could avoid the fates by
                bearing her brother's child.

            <para>
                Sometime in his twenties, in the 580's, Aeddan gathered a
                group of thegns about him, for by this point he was a great
                warrior who had fought the invaders, and a great hero, for
                having defeated many monsters, including the dragon Heoroth.
                He led more battles against the Rornish, and beat them,
                coming to rule the Kingdom of Westland (now Merkia, Langly
                and Westland shires) from a great city.

            <para>
                He was the first and last King to make good use of horses
                in combat, but was eventually defeated and his people were
                subsumed into Rornic culture.
