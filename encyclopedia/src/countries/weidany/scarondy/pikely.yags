            <para>
                Pikely is a town of about 900 people on the shore of <qv 
                uri="gaers-lake">Gaers Lake</qv>. Most of the town's 
                economy is based around fishing, though there is also a 
                garrison and supply depot here for the Queen's army.
            </para>

            <para>
                Pikely is not particularly pretty, nor is it pleasant to 
                the nose. Its major export is dried fish, and the smell 
                is the first thing noticed by visitors.
            </para>

            <para>
                The garrison can support two hundred troops, but 
                normally there are no more than a tenth of this based 
                here. As such, many of the barracks are in poor condition.
