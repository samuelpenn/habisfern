                The Kingdom of Aidan was a powerful kingdom that 
                existed about six hundred years ago. It made an 
                alliance with the Ents, and its armies almost 
                conquered much of what is now Weidany.

                wars that ended with them subsumed into what is 
                now the Kingdom of Weidany.
