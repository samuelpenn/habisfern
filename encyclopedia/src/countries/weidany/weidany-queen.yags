            <title>Queen of Weidany</title>

            <para>
                The current Queen of the Kingdom of Weidany is Queen Behrith,
                who ascended the throne in 1225. She was born in 1185, and
                is currently 45 years old. Her mother was Queen Frythrun,
                who ruled 1169-1213. Behrith's sister, Godrun the Red, took
                the throne at this point, but died after 12 years, due to,
                it is said, an inadvisedly late child birth.
            </para>

            <para>
                Queen Behrith currently has four daughters - Eodhild (born in
                1211), Wilith (1215), Aelflaed (1224) and Aeldith (1229). She
                is soon to be a grandmother, since both Eodhild and Wilith
                are due to give birth late in the year.
            </para>

            <para>
                Like all Queens of Weidany, Queen Behrith has never married.
                The first Queen Aelthryth started the tradition of ensuring
                that there were several possible fathers, reducing the
                influence that any of them could have either over the Queen
                or her daughters.

                            the barbarians of Merkia, and greatly expanded
                            the Kingdom. She was the first daughter of
                            Aelthryth, born in 998.

                            Hereswith. Werdrun was killed in 1127 by
                            Aeldith, and both Aeldith and Hereswith were
                            banished from the kingdom after they fled.
