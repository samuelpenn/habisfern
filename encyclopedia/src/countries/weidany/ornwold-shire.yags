            <title>The Shire of Ornwold</title>

            <para>
                Ornwold rates alongside the shire of
                <qv uri="westland-shire">Westland</qv> and
                <qv uri="lanuch-shire">Lanuch</qv> as one of the great
                three shires of the Kingdom, both in wealth and influence.
            </para>
            <para>
                It has traditionally been loyal to the Queen, which helps
                its influence no end, plus it has good access to the
                coast. The shire town is at <qv uri="depping-castle">
                Depping Castle</qv>, which overlooks a good natural
                harbour and is famous for its ship building.
            </para>
            <para>
                The <qv uri="river-kyle">River Kyle</qv> cuts through the
                middle of Ornwold, and meets the sea near Depping. The
                <qv uri="river-orn">River Orn</qv> is actually not in
                this shire. It's unclear what the connection is.
