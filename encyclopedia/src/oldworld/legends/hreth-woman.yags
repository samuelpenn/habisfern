            <para>
                A mortal woman who was the lover of <qv uri="erol">Erol</qv>,
                the son of <qv uri="haltan">Haltan</qv> in the Old World,
                before the coming of the Ice and the fall of civilisation.

            <para>
                Hreth betrayed Erol, and layed evidence for her crimes
                that pointed at Erol's mother, <qv uri="enrith">Enrith</qv>.
                Erol only found out the truth after he had slain his own
                mother
            </para>
            
            <para>
                Hreth was the daughter of the god <qv uri="pel">Pel</qv>
                and the giantess <qv uri="gruaga">Gruaga</qv>. Whether she
                is the same as the goddess <qv uri="hreth">Hreth</qv> is
                not known, but similarities between the two lead many to
                believe that she was.
