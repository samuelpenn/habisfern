                The name given to the martial arm of the Temples of Neya.
                They protect the temples, and the Daughters of Neya. For
                all purposes, they are considered to be a branch of the
                Daughters of Neya, and never act alone.
            </para>

            <para>
                The Shields will generally live separate from the Temple,
                and have their own training grounds, kitchens and a shrine.
                The garrison is normally next to or opposite the main
                Temple where the Daughters are housed, often with a shared
                open courtyard between them.
