            <title>Cult of Walgi</title>

            <para>
                The Mother of Wolves is a goddess of beasts and wild 
                places, and few humans have an interest in her, beyond a 
                desire to avoid her attentions. When sheep are taken by 
                wolves, or a child is lost in the woods, then it is 
                Walgi who is cursed.
            </para>

            <para>
                However, there are a few who know her ways. She is a 
                huntress as well as guardian of beasts, and she knows 
                well the laws of the wild. Men who hunt with respect are 
                shown respect in return, and the followers of the Cult 
                of the She Wolf teach and practise these ways.

                <title>The Grey Hunters</title>

                <para>
                    The Grey Hunters are followers of Walgi in her hunting 
                    aspect. They are woodsmen who wish the protection of the 
                    beast goddess whilst learning her secrets. They normally 
                    form small cults made up of huntsmen from several villages.
                </para>
    
                <para>
                    Caves are used as shrines by the Huntsman, with 
                    offerings of livestock when sacrifices are made. Mostly 
                    they seek protection of their homes from the wild.

                <para>
                    The cult of Walgi is two faced. Whilst the Grey Hunters 
                    are the repectable side, there is a second, darker path 
                    which a few followers of the cult sometimes take.

                <para>
                    Walgi the Beast Goddess leads her followers away from 
                    civilisation, towards the bestial side of their nature, 
                    slowly stripping their humanity from them.

                                The Grey Hunters follow the Cult of Walgi the wolf goddess.
                                They are often woodsmen who wish the protection of the
                                beast goddess, and maybe a small part of her power.
