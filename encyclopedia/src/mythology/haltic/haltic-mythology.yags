            <para>
                The people of the <qv uri="northern-kingdoms">Northern
                Kingdoms</qv> follow a set of gods not entirely dissimilar
                to those of <qv uri="rornic-mythology">Rorn</qv>. The people
                are of Rornic descent, though they split from those who
                settled <qv uri="weidany">Weidany</qv> well before the
                Betrayel which devastated
                <qv uri="tarvallah">Tarvallah</qv>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Their principal god is <qv uri="haltic">Haltic</qv>,
                equivalent to the Rornic <qv uri="haltan">Haltan</qv>,
                though somewhat bloodier in nature. Much of their
                mythology has come from the culture of <qv uri="milindor">
                Milindor</qv>, which was a magocracy based in what is now
                the <qv uri="hruul-forest">Hruul Forest</qv>. It collapsed
                during the 7th century, though vanished from the view of
                outsiders some time before this. Though wizards were the
                ruling elite, they shared their power base to some extent
                with the warrior cults of Haltan, who had a reputation
                more like those of <qv uri="asabeth">Asabeth</qv> than the
                Haltan of Rornic stories.
            </para>

            <para>
                Two gods, <qv uri="vihri">Vihri</qv> and <qv uri="kugmar">
                Kugmar</qv>, came from the east. Vihri was borrowed from
                the <qv uri="belogan-mythology">Belogan pantheon</qv>, and
                Kugmar from <qv uri="trollund">Trollund</qv>. The dragon god
                <qv uri="fartha">Fartha</qv>, who is similar to the Rornic
                <qv uri="farfthi">Farfthi<qv>, plays a prominent role, being
                worshipped by several cults.
            </para>

            <para>
                Those of the Northern Kingdoms have always lived closer to
                the <qv uri="ice">Ice</qv> than their neighbours, and their
                gods reflect this. They are more active, passionate and
                powerful than those of Rorn.
