                Hojan is a god of the wind. He is the only god not
                created either by Jorda or initially during the
                creation of the world. His parents are Igia and
                Uvangar.

            <para>
                Hojan is the breeze from the sea. He is a young
                and fickle god, considered a trickster and joker
                by the Brytish.

            <para>
                Hojan is only a minor god in Bryteland, hardly worshipped
                at all except by some sailors. In <qv uri="soroy">Soroy</qv>
                though he is considered far more important, and is considered
