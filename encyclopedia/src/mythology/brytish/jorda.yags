                At the beginning of the World there was only Jorda, the
                Great Earth Mother, and <qv uri="iss-brytish">Iss</qv>
                the Great Glacier which bore down upon her.

            <para>
                From the wounds gouged out of her flesh by Iss, Jorda
                gave birth to the World Dragon who was named
                <qv uri="jortooth">Jortooth</qv>. Jortooth drove back
                the Glacier, and so Jorda was able to bring forth life
                to the World by mating with her son.
            </para>

                parts of the World with ocean, and <qv uri="jorthik">
                Jorthik</qv> who is the soil about the land.

                After Jorthik and Jortooth war with each other, and Jorthik
                is slain, it is Jorda who breaths life into his remains.
                She creates <qv uri="voltan">Voltan</qv>,
