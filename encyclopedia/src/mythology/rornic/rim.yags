            <para>
                Rim was created out of the dreams of <qv uri="iss">Iss</qv>
                before the beginning of time, along with his sister
                <qv uri="yagma">Yagma</qv>.

                <para>
                    Rim is guardian of the souls of the dead. He gathers the
                    souls to him in the deep realms of the underworld, and
                    guides the souls on to their reincarnation when they are
                    ready.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    No one worships Rim, but all ask for his aid to help
                    loved ones find their way in the afterworld.
