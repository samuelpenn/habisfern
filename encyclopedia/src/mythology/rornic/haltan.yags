            <title>Haltan, King of the Gods</title>

            <para>
                Haltan was created at the dawn of the world. In
                the beginning, he was lord of the skies above
                the world. He dealt with the dragons and the
                birds, and spent much time with
                <qv uri="thot">Thot the Raven</qv>, for the
                skies were his domain also.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                Until the coming of Man, Haltan had little to
                do with the world itself. After the creation
                of Man, while the other gods dwelt upon the
                ground and worked directly with mankind, so
                Haltan watched from the skies, and from
                there he could see what the others could
                not. Man wandered the lands aimlessly,
                without purpose or direction, much like
                the animals. 
            </para>
            
            <para>
                Thinking that it would be better if Man had
                purpose and structure, he went down amongst
                them and tried to direct them, to set them
                to building temples so that he could easily
                see where they were. But there were so many
                men, that it took all Haltan's time telling
                each one where to go, and what to do. Even
                with the help of Thot to carry instructions
                to all the Men, Haltan had no time left to
                sit back and relax, and watch the world from
                his sky dwellings.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                So Haltan took a few Men, and instructed
                them to instruct others. To make it easier
                for them, he taught them and all other Men
                language, so that they could talk to each
                other and organise themselves.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                In one move, Haltan had given Man both
                language and organised society. These thegns
                went out amongst the other men, and carried
                the word of Haltan to them, organising
                themselves into great cities.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Interests and Worshippers</title>

                <para>
                    Haltan is the god of law and justice, of duty
                    and war. He is the leader of the gods, even
                    above Rim and Yagma who were the first gods.
                    He is also god of the sky and weather, so even
                    those who have no interest in rulership and
                    war need him for a good harvest. 
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    All those who rule give thanks to, and seek advice
                    from, Haltan. By many, he is seen as the most
                    important of the gods, since he symbolises the
                    very structure of society.
