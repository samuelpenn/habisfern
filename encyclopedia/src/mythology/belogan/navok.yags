            <para>
                Navok is another one of the Inhuman Gods, who are 
                not descended from the <qv 
                uri="three-mothers">Three Mothers</qv>. He is 
                night and darkness, the unknown things in the 
                world. He crept in during the <qv 
                uri="belogan-great-winter">Great Winter</qv>, and 
                sided with the gods against the <qv 
                uri="ice">Ice</qv>. However, his loyalties are unknown.
            </para>

            <para>
                He is considered to be a god of chaos and 
                misdirection. As such, his cults tend to favour 
                thieves and others who live outside the law. 
                However, there is no standard teaching shared by 
                his cults.
