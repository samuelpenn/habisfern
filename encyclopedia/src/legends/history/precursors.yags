            <para>
                Civilisations have risen and fallen on Eorthe, and even humanity
                has fallen before. The current era is that which follows the last
                great incursions of the <qv uri="ice">Ice</qv>, and consists of
                the last two to three thousand years. Before that were the
                <qv uri="ancients">Ancients</qv>, which existed back to maybe
                ten thousand years ago, living during the great Ice.
            </para>
            <para>
                There were civilisations even before this time though, and they
                are known as the <e>Precursors</e>. Almost nothing is known of
                these civilisations, for none survive from that time and beyond
                a few ruins or scrap of barely translated writings there is
                little to go on save for stories.
            </para>
            <para>
                The most notable of the Precursors were the <qv uri="elders">Elders</qv>,
                who had a great <qv uri="serpent-kingdoms">Serpent Kingdoms</qv>
                that stretched across most of <qv uri="gyla">Gyla</qv>. A few
                of its ruins still remain, for they built many huge monuments,
                some of which are still partially standing. For this reason they
                are also sometimes called the
                <qv uri="monument-builders">Monument Builders</qv>, though there is
                an argument that these two civilisations were not the same.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Serpent Kingdom used humans as slaves during this time, and
                after the fall of the Elders, these slaves built their own
                empire, that of <qv uri="yigsortha">Yigsortha</qv> in south
                eastern Gyla. Like their previous masters, they too built great
                structures, but the empire collapsed with the coming of the
                Ice, as southern Gyla dried up and became desert.
            </para>
            <para>
                Other Precursors may have existed, but the amount known about
                them is little. There are hints of a human Precursor civilisation
                in the far south, but that does not even have a name.
