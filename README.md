Habisfern fantasy campaign setting

This is an open source fantasy campaign setting designed for YAGS, and released under the GPL.

The bulk of the content is written in Yagsbook encyclopedia format, so that it can be rendered to 
different output formats. Because it is licensed under the GPL, the source format will always be
available to everyone so that PDFs and HTML can be easily re-generated.

The setting has been on hold for the last few years, but it is merely sleeping.
