<h1>Belogan Mythology</h1>

<p>
There was the universe, and it was called Beloga. The universe created
the <em>Three Mothers</em>, who were Ladma, Zharva and Dalvi. The mated
with themselves, and produced Morav, who was Death, and Svargi who was
to be the Father.
Svargi mated with Ladma and Zharva, and together they begat the Earth.
Svargi then mated with Morav, and so were born the first humans. Some of
these rose to become gods, while others stayed in the world.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this, there was much war amongst the gods. They bickered over
the mortals and each claimed as many as they could as woshippers. Each
god wanted domain over the Earth, so there was much fighting. Many gods
died, most of whom are now forgotton.
</p>

<p>
Then there was the great war against the Ice, when the Great Winter settled
upon the Earth, and most upon it died. Only after Svargi united the remaining
gods against it was it defeated. Shortly after the defeat of the Ice, there
was peace amongst the gods, but Svargi could see that the peace was a fragile
thing that could not last.
</p>

<p>
So Svargi went to Beloga, and after many quests gained wisdom from the
universe. Makosh was created, who was Fate. She gave to Svargi the Secret
Wisdoms, and told him to distribute it amongst the gods, for the Wisdoms
would bind the gods to a particular aspect of the Universe, and they would
have control over that aspect and none other. That way the gods would be
restricted from fighting over the same things.
</p>

<p>
The gods were persuaded into accepting this idea, mainly because Svargi
held all the Wisdom, which gave him ultimate power. The gods gamed for
the Secret Wisdoms, and it was dealt out as they one it.
