<h1>The Creation Myth</h1>

<p>
In the beginning, the World was in two parts. There was Jorda, the Earth,
who held within her all that could give forth life. Covering Jorda, and
crushing her so that she could not give birth to life, was Iss, the
Great Glacier, which was barren and cold. As Iss ground down upon Jorda,
so he gouged out great wounds in her flesh, and from the blood of these
wounds was born Jortooth, the World Dragon, made from the blood of the
great mother.
</p>

<p>
The Jortooth rose against Iss, and with his terrible breath of fire forced
Iss back to the distant north, to cower in fear against the fire. Freed
from her ice prison, Jorda mates with Jortooth, and gives birth to three
Primal Lords, who are Othalking of the Sky and Winds, Uvangar of the Deep
Seas, and Jorthik of the Earth. Jorthik though is deprived from having
dominion of all that he considers his, because his father also dwells in
the earth, so Jorthik fights his father, but is defeated, and his body is
torn apart.
</p>

<p>
Distressed at the death of her son, Jorda breaths life back into the bloody
ruins of his body. From his brains comes Voltan who is gifted with poetry
and law. From his heart comes Freeja, who loves and cares for others. From
his blood comes Igia, who fills the rivers of the land and flows down into
the sea which becomes her domain. From the ribs of Jorthik springs Alfhan,
who makes himself as the trees which cover the land. Walgi the wolf goddess
is born from his teeth. Finally from one of his eyes comes Rim, who is
guardian and watcher of both the living and the dead.
</p>

<h3>The Rape of Igia<h3>

<p>
Othalking is lord of the sky and storms, and has dominion over the gods.
He considers all beneath him to be his, including the seas, and Igia who
dwells within the waves. He kidnaps her, and takes her up to his sky
kingdom Thalling. Her brothers rebel, and led by Voltan they make a
raid on Thalling, freeing Igia and fleeing with her back to the sea.
Othalking is furious at this, and follows after the gods to take back
his prize. Knowing that they cannot defeat one of the Primal Lords alone,
Voltan petitions Uvangar for aid.
</p>

<p>
For this price, Uvangar demands that Igia stays in his palace with him
for half of each year. Voltan, singing a poem that praises Uvangar and
the respect he'd receive for helping the gods, bargains him down to one
season out of each year.
</p>

<p>
When Othalking arrives, the gods lay a trap for him, and he is defeated
and bound. He is chained in the far west, where he can do no more harm.
</p>

<p>
Igia goes back to the sea, and spends the winter of each year in the
deep depths with Uvangar. It is during this first winter that she
has a son, Hojan, son of Othalking.
