<h1>Besenreth, Fenya's Shadow</h1>

<p>
It is said by some that when Fenya was born, she had a sister
who was disliked by the gods, and was cast out from their realm.
She hid in the dark places of the world, and came to know how to
move and live on the borders of society.
</p>

<p>
After Rorn was slain, and Fenya took up the guiding of the Moon
on its path around the world, so Besenreth came to live in the
shadow of her sister. She would come out at night, keeping to the
shadows cast by the Moon so that none would see her.
