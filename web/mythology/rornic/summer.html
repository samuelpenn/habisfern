<h1>The Age of Summer</h1>

<p>
The first Tribes of Man live in what is to them a paradise for
a long time, and spread out across the world, living by hunting
animals, and gathering plants which the gods laid down for them.
</p>

<p>
After a while, as the numbers of men grew, so they started to
think of building places to live, and so they built for themselves
many cities, of which Logreth, Ideria and Ubra were the greatest.
</p>

<p>
The people of Logreth live on the coast in the far east of the world,
and build great temples to Moern. With his aid, they become great
sailors.
</p>

<p>
The people of Ideria follow the ways of Reas, and build a beautiful
city of open spaces, with with gardens and music, surrounded by
buildings of great beauty.
</p>

<p>
The greatest of the cities is Ubra, whose people dedicate their city
to Haltan. They form many laws, and have great places of learning,
sprawling markets and houses of men stretching from horizon to horizon.
</p>

<p>
Not all of mankind live within cities though. Some deem to follow
the ways of Rorn, and take to exploring the world. Rorn himself
takes up to dwelling with the Moon and the Sun, from where he can
watch the entire world.
</p>

<h2>The Frost Giants</h2>

<p>
Eventually, the Travellers bring tails of another People in the
far North of the world, who live by great walls of Ice, and who
are taller and stronger then Men, and who call themselves Giants.
The Giants have many tools of war — swords and spears and armour,
something that Men do not have. When the Giants begin to move south
towards Ubra, for it is the northernmost of the large Cities of
Man, its people call on Haltan for aid. Haltan though has had no
experience of war, so goes to talk to the leader of the Giants,
one called Brokki.
</p>

<p>
Brokki, who is much a god himself, explains that his people want
the lands that Man inhabits, and are willing to take them by
force. Eventually Haltan convinces Brokki to a contest, and if
Haltan wins, Brokki will give the secrets of their weapons to him.
</p>

<p>
The nature of the contest is chosen by Gruaga, Brokki's wife, and
Gitriw, already the most truthful of the gods, is bound by the
magic of Haltan and Brokki to only ever speak the truth, such that
she may judge the contest fairly.
</p>

<p>
Gruaga demands that both craft a perfect item, and when both are
constructed, whichever is the most perfect will win the contest.
</p>

<p>
Brokki creates the great sword Helvanger, which is given virtues
such that it cannot be stopped by armour, or another weapon, as well
as virtues of sharpness and quickness.
</p>

<p>
Haltan creates the most perfect being. A beautiful man whom he
calls Pel. Contrary to the agreement of the contest, he has help
from Reas, to ensure that Pel is the most beautiful being ever
made, in form and voice and actions.
</p>

<p>
Unseen by Brokki, his work is watched by the raven Thot, who
learns the secrets of smith craft.
</p>

<p>
When the contest is completed, Gitriw is brought in to judge, and
discovers that Helvanger has a flaw. Brokki is outraged, and calls
on the giants to hold Haltan and Gitriw, but they escape, and
Haltan is taught the secrets learnt by Thot. Pel however is captured,
and remains within the giant citadel.
</p>

<p>
Haltan returns to Ubra and teaches Man how to make weapons. When
the Giants march on the cities of Man, there is a great war, and
eventually the Giants are driven back northwards, but not before
many cities, including Ubra, are ruined.
</p>

<p>
Ubra is rebuilt, with great walls of stone, and a great army is
raised in order to defend it. Eventually other cities do the same,
and war breaks out between many of them, as Mankind learns the arts
of War.
</p>

<p>
As the Summer draws to a close, many Men in the north flee south
for warmer climes, as the great Ice begins its march southwards.
One of these people is named Fenoth, who settles in the city of
Logreth. Fenoth spreads rumours and lies about the other Cities of
Man, He befriends the Lords of the city, and turns them against both
Ubra and Moern. The people eventually rise up against the temples,
and slay their priests, before setting sail with a huge fleet to
raid Ubra. Moern is outraged, and sends storms to smash the fleet,
and drown the city.
</p>

<p>
Eventually the Ice towers over the city of Ubra, and it is
abandoned to the north.
