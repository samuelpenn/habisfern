<h1>The Dawn Time</h1>

<p>
With the passage of time, day and night existed on the world.
Rivers flowed to seas, and rain fell on mountains. Apart from
Giants and Dragons though, there was no life in the world.
</p>

<p>
The two gods Yagma and Rim looked out over the world, and saw
that it was not good. It was bare, but not lifeless. The soul
of Iss permeated everything, laying across rocks and rivers
where it had fallen, filling the seas and mountains with its
energy. But it was form-less, without pattern.
</p>

<p>
But having been part of the Dreams of Iss, the two gods knew
some of what he had dreamed, and saw a way to form pattern out
of the chaos. Rim gathered together the life of Iss, and trapped
it beneath the World, where it could not interfere with what was
being made above.
</p>

<p>
Yagma took the earth and rocks, and fashioned grass and bushes and
trees, and with the help of Rim, channelled some of the soul of
Iss into them, so that they became alive. And so life and colour
began to fill the world.
</p>

<p>
Filled with confidence over the success of her first attempts,
Yagma created fish for the sea, birds for the air, and animals
for the land, filling them with life, and sending them out into
the World, fulfilling more of the dreams of Iss.
</p>

<p>
But all was not good, for over time, the world began to fail. The
sun and the moon rose at different times each day, in many places
rains fell so hard that whole countries were flooded, while in others,
it never fell at all so that all life died.
</p>

<p>
It was more than Yagma and Rim could do to keep everything in
order, so they created Estror and Gitriw to tend to the plants
and animals, Haltan to watch the skies, Moern to look after the
seas and Reas to ensure beauty was found everywhere. Lastly,
there was created Thot, who acted as the messenger to carry
instructions for everyone else.
</p>

<p>
These were the gods and goddesses of the Dawn, known by Man as
the Daegian.
</p>

<h2>The Creation of Man</h2>

<p>
For many ages, the world ran smoothly under the careful nurturing
of the gods. Eventually though Haltan decided that it would be
better if some of the animals had speech and thought.
</p>

<p>
He went to Rim and Yagma, and asked for their aid, for it would be
a difficult task to create something outside of the Dream, such that
it had free will.
</p>

<p>
So Rim and Yagma together created a seed, which was placed within
the body of Yagma, and after much time, she gave birth to Rorn, the
first of the gods to be born. The birth of Rorn showed the way to
creating Man, and so Yagma gave birth to the first Men, basing them
on the form of Rorn.
</p>

<p>
And so the first Men were created, and with them Women, and they
were shown language by Haltan, so they could communicate and build
up civilisations. Gitriw taught them the meaning of truth, so they
could work together, and Rorn showed them the meaning of free will.
</p>

<p>
The first tribes of Man went out into the world, and so ended the
Dawn Time.
