<h2>The Gods</h2>

<h3>The Daegian</h3>

<p>
The gods of the dawn, these are the gods created at the dawn of the world,
after the Firistwinter had ended. Yagma and Rim were the first gods, created
from the dreams of the sleeping god Iss. Together, they created the rest of
the Daegian, and together, the Daegian created the world as it is today.
</p>

<ul>
	<a href="estror.html">Estror, the Dawn Goddess</a>. She guided the
	world in its infancy, and now cares for the newborn.
	<br />
	
	<a href="gitriw.html">Gitriw, Truth Speaker</a>. Bound to speak
	only the truth, Gitriw is invoked at hundred meets when justice
	is sought.
	<br />
	
	<a href="haltan.html">Haltan, King of the Gods</a>. God of the sky,
	and ruler of the gods, Haltan is god of law and order. It was he
	who slew Rorn, his half-brother, who was previously considered to
	be lord over the gods.
	<br />
	
	<a href="moern.html">Moern, Sea Father</a>. Morn is the endless
	deep, the lurker below, who sleeps beneath the oceans of the world.
	When arosed, he is angry and violent, and those who travel on his
	waters soon learn how to placate him.
	<br />
	
	<a href="reas.html">Reas, the Craftsman</a>. Reas is a skilled
	craftsman, a creator of beauty. He is a smith and a bard, capable
	of crafting beauty from words as well as from metals.
	<br />
	
	<a href="rim.html">Rim, God of the Dead</a>. The first of the
	gods, he and Yagma created the rest of the world. Rim dwells
	beneath the earth, and safe guards the souls of the dead ready
	for their resurrection.
	<br />
	
	<a href="thot.html">Thot, the Raven</a>. He is said to be the
	craftiest of the gods. He sees and hears much that goes on in
	the world, and sometimes reports such findings to the gods, if
	it suits him. He is closely allied to Haltan, and is often his
	messenger.
	<br />
	
	<a href="yagma.html">Yagma, Earth Mother</a>. Created first along
	with Rim, Yagma created the world and all that is in it. She is
	the goddess of the eternal cycle of life, from birth to death.
	<br >
</ul>

<h3>The Younger Gods</h3>

<p>
The first of the younger gods was Rorn, born out of the womb of Yagma,
fathered by Rim. Rorn was the first god to be born, rather than made,
and the rest of the younger gods are likewise descended from other gods.
</p>

<ul>
	<a href="besenreth.html">Besenreth, Fenya's Shadow</a>. Few have
	heard of Besenreth, though the rangers of Tuffin Wood say she is
	the sister of Fenya. She can be found wherever the light of Fenya
	does not fall. She is the goddess of secret places and unknown
	paths.
	<br />
	
	<a href="bis.html">Bis, the Sun God</a>. Bis drives the chariot
	which pulls the sun around the world.
	<br />
	
	<a href="fenya.html">Fenya, Moon Daughter</a>. After the death of
	Rorn, she took up the guiding of the moon on its course. She now
	sits within the Moon, and watches the world. It is said that the
	Moon became beautiful when she took up residence.
	<br />
	
	<a href="gyltith.html">Gyltith, the Sorrowful</a>. Daughter of Rorn
	and Estror, Gyltith is cursed with seeing the future. She can only
	see what she does not want to see however.
	<br />
	
	<a href="hreth.html">Hreth, Winter's Cloak</a>. Daughter of Rorn
	and Estror, she is a feared and terrible god, who sold her soul to
	the Ice during the Age of Winter.
	<br />
	
	<a href="neya.html">Neya, the Keeper of Oaths</a>. Daughter of
	Haltan and Asabeth, she is the patron goddess of the Queen of
	the Kingdom of Rorn.
	<br />
	
	<a href="rorn.html">Rorn the Wanderer</a>. Created as a prototype
	human, the rest of mankind was made in his image. He became lord
	of the gods, until he was betrayed and slain by his own half-brother,
	Haltan.
	<br />
</ul>

<h3>Other Gods</h3>

<ul>
	<a href="asabeth.html">Asabeth, the Warrior</a>. Asabeth is an
	eastern god, who came to the west many years after Rorn had
	travelled that path. She met Haltan, and bested him, taking him
	hostage for a year and forcing him to be her husband. She is
	a great warrior, though full of anger and jealousy.
	<br />
		
	<a href="meam.html">Meam, the Outcast</a>. Son of Haltan, Meam's
	mother was a cow. He is an ugly, bestial creature, scorned by the
	rest of the gods. Dwelling on the edge of civilisation, he has
	rejected the ways of civilisation, and delights in the abuse and
	pain of others.
	<br />
	
	<a href="pel.html">Pel, the Perfect God</a>. Created by Haltan and
	Reas during a contest with the giant Brokki. He is utterly beautiful,
	and is said to be the greatest work of craftmanship ever to come out
	of Reas' hands.
	<br />
	
	<a href="tharos.html">Tharos, Night Stalker</a>. He came with
	Asabeth from the east, but never joined the other gods. He spurns
	friends and family, and lives alone, surviving on his own wits.
	He has shown himself to be untrustworthy, capable of murder and
	theft.
	<br />
	
	<a href="walgi.html">Walgi, Wolf Mother</a>. No-one knows where
	Walgi came from, but she is the animal god, self-proclaimed mother
	of all the animals, especially those which hunt man.
	<br />
</ul>
