<h1>The Age of Winter</h1>

<p>
A great citadel of ice is built above the ruins of the city of
Ubra, and within it dwells Snaw, son of Brokki and leader of
the Giants who have raided south with the Ice.
</p>

<p>
In the south, a man is born, fathered by Haltan on the mortal
woman Enrith. He is named Erol, and is taught the ways of warfare
by his father, and the ways of magic by his mother. He is a great
hero, and wins many battles against the Giants.
</p>

<p>
He falls in love with a woman named Hreth.
</p>

<p>
Hreth betrays him at a great battle, and leaves evidence pointing
to his mother. It is only after he has killed Enrith for her apparent
treachery that he learns the truth, but Hreth has already fled north
to Snaw's citadel. So Erol fathers together a group of warriors to
go after her.
</p>

<p>
Erol and most of his companions are slain, before they can bring
Hreth to justice. The manage to free Pel though, and discover that
Hreth is his daughter, by Gruaga.
</p>

<h2>The Fall of Ideria</h2>

<p>
Ideria is the last of the great cities of Man, still beautiful after
the other great cities have fallen. It is watched over by Rorn, who
is set to guarding the northern reaches against the Ice.
