<h1>The Gods of Rorn</h1>

<p>
The gods feature heavily in the life of the people, for all that
happens does so because of the gods. If the gods are not placated,
then fields will become infertile, storms will ravish the countryside,
and people will die. Few of the gods are malicious though.
Nevertheless, people placate them just to ensure that they keep on
their good side.
</p>

<h2>Asabeth</h2>

<p>
Asabeth is a powerful goddess of war and revenge. She demands the
sacrifice of prisoners taken in war (generally, by nailing them to
a tree). Long ago, when men still dwelt in Tarvallah, she came
across with the Eastlings (those men who came after the followers
of Rorn, and dwelt to the east of Tarvallah, and who did not look
to Rorn as their god).
</p>

<p>
Asabeth fought with Haltan at the borders of Tarvallah, and she
prevailed, taking Haltan as her prisoner, chaining him in his own
hall. She raped him, and kept him as prisoner until after the birth
of their children (Fenya, Bis and Neya). She freed Haltan, and gave
herself to him as his wife. She deserted her people, and left them
to suffer outside Tarvallah.
</p>

<p>
She is a warrior goddess, quick to anger, and eager for the death of
her enemies. Asabeth is considered to be barbaric by most people,
though various cults to her have risen up over time, most notably in
Estwed.
</p>

<h2>Bis</h2>

<p>
God of the sun, mischief and chaos. He drives the chariot which
pulls the sun around the world once a day, but sometimes strays from
his path.
</p>

<h2>Estror</h2>

<p>
She is the goddess of dawn, spring and new life. While Yagma grants
the conception of a child, Estror will look after the newborn.
</p>

<h2>Fenya</h2>

<p>
She is the goddess who took up the task of leading the moon in its
course around the world after the death of Rim. She is goddess of the
moon, beauty and the night. She is the brother of Bis, and the
daughter of Rorn and Neya. She is also seen as the huntress.
</p>

<h2>Haltan</h2>

<p>
Haltan is the god of the Sky, storms, war and justice. Though he was
defeated by Asabeth, he is considered to be the most skilled of the
gods at war, and is thereby favoured by warriors. His wisdom and
general desire for justice also makes him a lot more respectable
than his wife. He is the most powerful of the male gods.
</p>

<p>
He was brother to Rorn, though at the time of the Betrayal, it was he
who challenged Rorn (after being goaded into doing so by Asabeth), and
slew him in combat. Because of Rorn‘s death, men were forced out of
Tarvallah, into the less fertile lands to the north.
</p>

<p>
He wields the great sword Helvanger.
</p>

<h2>Gitriw</h2>

<p>
One of the original gods of the Daegian, she taught truth and
cooperation to the animals of the world during its dawn. The gods
and the Giants lay bindings of truth upon her in order such that she
could fairly judge a contest between Brokki and Haltan, and from that
day on, has never been able to tell a lie.
</p>

<h2>Gyltith</h2>

<p>
She is the silent witness, goddess of sorrow and remorse. Her guidance
is sought by those who wish for different pasts or futures. She is also
the goddess of both prophecy and hindsight.
</p>

<h2>Hreth</h2>

<p>
She is the goddess of winter, the cold wind and the bringer of snow.
Generally considered too close to the Ice to be friendly, she is called
upon more to stay away than anything. Her form is that of a great winged
beast who can cover the world with her snowy wings.
</p>

<h2>Meam</h2>

<p>
Meam is a demi-god, born out of the unnatural union of Haltan and a
cow. He is an ugly, deformed monster, often pitiful, but incredibly
strong. His own offspring, of which there are many, are the ettin.
</p>

<h2>Neya</h2>

<p>
Neya is the goddess of peace, serenity and marriage. She is the
Keeper of Oaths, and the vengeance which strikes down those that
break oaths made on her name is the only time she shows anger or
violence.
</p>

<p>
Her priestesses look after the Queen of Rorn, and decide the succession.
</p>

<h2>Pel</h2>

<p>
Pel was created by Haltan and Reas, and in attempt to craft the most
perfect person in order to win the secrets of weapon making from the
Giant god Brokki. Pel is beautiful, being physically perfect in all
ways. However, he is somewhat shallow of personality, and very vain.
</p>

<h2>Rim</h2>

<p>
The god of death, he lives beneath the world, and gathers in the souls
of the dead. It is also his task to pass out souls to the newborn though,
so as well as being god of death, he is also god of life. To this end,
he has a close relationship with Yagma.
</p>

<p>
Rim, along with Yagma, was the first god, created from the dreams of Iss.
</p>

<h2>Rorn</h2>

<p>
Rorn the Wanderer was the moon god, who watched against the coming
of the Ice when men dwelt in the East. His distraction from his task
by a mortal woman cause the fall of man, and his guilt led him to lead
as many as he could to safety, eventually bringing his followers to
the fertile lands of Tarvallah.
</p>

<p>
He was a watcher, though beset by wander lust. He was killed by Haltan
in single combat.
</p>

<h2>Thot</h2>

<p>
The Raven, and messenger of the gods, Thot sees everything that goes
on in the world. He is as swift as the gale, capable of being anywhere
in the land in no time at all. Clever and crafty, he can also be a
trickster, spy and blackmailer.
</p>

<h2>Walgi</h2>

<p>
The Wolf Mother, guardian of the beasts and huntress of man. Though
she is considered to be the enemy of men, she is seen as an honourable
foe, one who is to be respected rather than feared.
</p>

<p>
Those who hunt her children often call on her before hand, to declare
their intentions so that she may look kindly on them. To those who
play by her rules, she is a good loser. To those who abuse her children,
and mock her, her vengeance is swift.
</p>

<h2>Yagma</h2>

<p>
She is the Earth Mother, the most powerful of the gods. She is a
fertility goddess, who bargains with Rim for the souls for all newborn
life. She is petitioned for conception, pregnancy, agriculture, rain
and the harvest.
</p>

<p>
Yagma is as much though a goddess of Death as she is of Life. It is
she who turns the wheel of time, that eventually brings all things
full circle.
