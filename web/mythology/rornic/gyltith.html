No-one wants the eyes of Gyltith to pass over them, for if they

<h1>Gyltith, the Sorrowful</h1>

<p>
Gyltith was born of Rorn and Estror, and like her sister
<a href="hreth.html">Hreth</a>, fate did not turn out well
for her. At first, she sought knowledge of the world, and
aimed to write down all that had happened in the world.
</p>

<p>
She grew tired though of always being behind in what happened,
and tried to find an easy way to keep up to date, by knowing
what was going to happen before it did. She believed that the
future of the world was foretold in the Dreams of Iss, and
when Yagma and Rim refused to tell her of them, she travelled
to the far north, to the great castle of the frost giant Brokki,
which was crafted from the skull of Iss.
</p>

<p>
She starved herself, and sat in meditation for many days. On
the twelth day, she was rewarded with glimpse of the mind of
Iss, and a vision of the future. Since that time, she has
refused to speak of what she saw, saying only that their is
a great darkness in the future from which it is impossible to
escape.
