<h1>The Time Before Time</h1>


<p>
The World existed forever in cold and darkness, in the Firestwinter
that consumed everything. At this time, there was no sun or moon or
stars by which to count time, and so the Firestwinter lasted unmeasurably.
</p>

<p>
Not all though was dead, for there was the god Iss, whose body of snow
and ice lay across the World enveloping it in a shroud of cold. Though
the flesh of Iss was of ice, within his veins flowed liquid fire. And
so Iss slept for unmeasurable time, embracing the World in his frigid
body.
</p>

<p>
Iss though did not slumber without dreams, and it is these dreams which
gave life to the world. From his imagination, Iss dreamt of a time when
Time existed, and dreamt of beasts and gods and men. With these dreams,
Iss shaped the World around him. He dreamt of Dragons, and great winged
serpents crawled from his mouth. He dreamt of Giants, and giants grew
from his back.
</p>

<p>
Without Time, the Giants and Dragons did not age, and could not die,
needing neither food nor warmth to sustain them. They made homes in the
caves between Iss' teeth, and in the mountains of his back.
</p>

<h2>Yagma and Rim, the Death of Iss</h2>

<p>
Much later, and at the same time, Iss dreamt of gods, and the gods
Rim and Yagma were born. They sprung into life beneath the chest of
Iss, trapped between the Ice of his body and the cold rock of the
World. For a while, both gods lay trapped beneath Iss, until Rim
fashioned a huge blade from the frozen hairs on Iss‘ chest, and with
it cut a hole through his flesh, seeking a way to climb to the surface.
</p>

<p>
Iss was awoken at this cut, and confused by the pain, he scrambled to
his feet, spraying blood of liquid fire from his chest. The dragons and
giants fell from his back and mouth, fearful for what was happening,
for this was the first time anything other than themselves had moved
in the World.
</p>

<p>
The dragons were the first to notice the fire on the ground, and flew
and crawled to it, seeking the please of warmth for the first time in
their existence, gorging themselves on the blood. Some sought the source
of this warmth, and flew to the wound, tearing at the flesh to get at
the warmth within. Feeling nothing but pain, Iss grabbed at those
dragons which were tearing at his chest, and tore all but one away,
crushing them in his fist, and on the ground.
</p>

<p>
That one dragon was Farfthi, who was the largest and quickest of the
dragons. His great neck reached into the wound of Iss, and grabbed at
his flaming heart with his jaws. Before Iss could act, Farfthi flew up
and away, ripping his heart from Iss‘ chest.
</p>

<p>
But Iss did could not die, so he drew up a handful of ice, rock and
snow, and hurled it at Farfthi who was too far above him to be reached.
He missed Farfthi, but caused the dragon to drop his heart, leaving it
on a path that would take it around the world once a day. The ball of
ice and rock took up a similar trail, and they came to be called Sun
and Moon, and together they marked the passage of Time.
</p>

<p>
With the coming of Time, so the dragons who Iss had crushed died, and
Iss himself toppled to the earth, his blood spilling across great parts
of it melting the Ice which had been the only land in the worlds before
Time.
</p>

<p>
The body of Iss melted, and became the seas, his bones became the
mountains and the drops of his blood the stars. His skull fell in the
far north of the world, where the dreams of Iss lived on, and the
giants went north to worship their creator, making his skull into a
great temple dedicated to Iss.
