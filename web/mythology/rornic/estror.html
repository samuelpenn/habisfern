<h1>Estror, Goddess of the Dawn</h1>

<p>
Estror was one of the first gods, created by Rim and Yagma at the
dawn of the world. She takes after Yagma the most, taking some of
her responsibility onto herself.
</p>

<p>
After Yagma and Rim had breathed life into the world, Estror went
out amongst the new life, and tended to it, helping it grow into
what it is today. She tended grass and bushes and trees, the fish
in the sea and the animals on the land. She has a love for all things
that grow, and is saddened by their deaths at the end of their life.
</p>

<p>
Though Estror and Yagma are venerated for much the same things, they
have a different outlook. Estror truly loves all that lives, whilst
Yagma is uncaring and impassionate. Yagma is as much a goddess of
death as she is of life.
