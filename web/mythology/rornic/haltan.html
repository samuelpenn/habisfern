Haltan is the god of law and justice, of duty and war.
He is the leader of the gods, even above Rim and Yagma
who were the first gods. He is also god of the sky and
weather, so even those who have no interest in rulership
and war need him for a good harvest.

<h1>Haltan, King of the Gods</h1>

<p>
Haltan was created at the dawn of the world. In the beginning, he
was lord of the skies above the world. He dealt with the dragons
and the birds, and spent much time with <a href="thot.html">Thot</a>
the Raven, for the skies were his domain also.
</p>

<p>
Until the coming of Man, Haltan had little to do with the world
itself. After the creation of Man, while the other gods dwelt
upon the ground and worked directly with mankind, so Haltan watched
from the skies, and from there he could see what the others could
not. Man wandered the lands aimlessly, without purpose or direction,
much like the animals.
</p>

<p>
Thinking that it would be better if Man had purpose and structure,
he went down amongst them and tried to direct them, to set them
to building temples so that he could easily see where they were.
But there were so many men, that it took all Haltan's time telling
each one where to go, and what to do. Even with the help of Thot
to carry instructions to all the Men, Haltan had no time left to
sit back and relax, and watch the world from his sky dwellings.
</p>

<p>
So Haltan took a few Men, and instructed them to instruct others.
To make it easier for them, he taught them and all other Men
language, so that they could talk to each other and organise
themselves.
</p>

<p>
In one move, Haltan had given Man both language and organised
society. These thegns went out amongst the other men, and carried
the word of Haltan to them, organising themselves into great
cities.
