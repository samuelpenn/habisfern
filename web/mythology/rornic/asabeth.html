Asabeth is a warrior goddess, skilled in sword and spear, and filled with a
passion for war and death. She is the goddess of blood feuds, of fighting
because of hatred, anger or a simple passion for violence.

Worshippers of Asabeth are few. Most who follow the warrior path choose Haltan
as their patron, since he is the god of honourable war. The majority of Asabeth
followers are female warriors, though even here she is rarely found.

<h1>Asabeth, the Warrior</h1>

<p>
Asabeth is unrelated to the rest of the gods - she came from the East while mankind
was living in Tarvallah. She came with the Eastlings (those men who came after the
followers of Rorn, and dwelt to the east of Tarvallah, and who did not look to Rorn
as their god).
</p>

<p>
Asabeth is a powerful goddess of war and revenge. She demands the
sacrifice of prisoners taken in war (generally, by nailing them to
a tree).
</p>

<p>
Asabeth fought with Haltan at the borders of Tarvallah, and she
prevailed, taking Haltan as her prisoner, chaining him in his own
hall. She raped him, and kept him as prisoner until after the birth
of their children (Fenya, Bis and Neya). She freed Haltan, and gave
herself to him as his wife. She deserted her people, and left them
to suffer outside Tarvallah.
</p>

<p>
She is a warrior goddess, quick to anger, and eager for the death of
her enemies. Asabeth is considered to be barbaric by most people,
though various cults to her have risen up over time, most notably in
Estwed.
