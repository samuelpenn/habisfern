<h1>Meam the Outcast</h1>

<p>
When <a href="asabeth.html">Asabeth</a> was trying to kill 
<a href="rorn.html">Rorn</a> so that
her husband could become lord of the gods, she tricked Rorn and
<a href="haltan.html">Haltan</a>
into going off on a suicidal quest to retrieve the cursed sword Helvanger.
She needed to distract Haltan from the quest however, so caused a cow to
take the shape of a beautiful woman. The woman waylayed Haltan, and Rorn
completed the quest on his own. From the union of Haltan and the nameless
cow, sprang Meam - half god half beast, who grew to maturity within a year,
raised by his mother.
</p>

<p>
Meam was born and grew up in the years following the death of Rorn, when
the land was broken, and food was scarce. At the end of the first year,
Meam was forced to eat his mother, for there was no other food in the
valley where he lived. Not knowing who he was, or who his father was, Meam
set off into the world to find out the answers to both questions.
</p>

<p>
Meam came across a small village, which he entered openely, seeking food
and shelter. As soon as he was seen, the villagers took up stones and sticks
to drive him from their village. Meam was half a god, but he was also only
half a man, and half a beast as well. Cloven hooves, jutting jaw, bulging
veins and miscoloured skin are only some of the disfigurements Meam suffered
from. Going from village to village, Meam was driven out again and again.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, he came to a cave in a forest, where an old man sat. The old
man did not shy away from the sight of Meam, but instead offered him food
and shelter.
</p>

<p>
"Who am I?" Asks Meam of the old man.
</p>

<p>
"You are the son of the god Haltan. He created you, and it is he who
owes you sanctuary."
</p>

<p>
Meam went looking for his father. Laughed at by gods. Thieving on
edge of civilisation. Comes across two sisters, rapes and kills them.
They are daughters of Bis.
</p>

<h2>Cults of Meam</h2>

<p>
Meam cultists are generally made up of sadists and sociopaths, often
those who have themselves been spurned by society, either through their
own actions, or because of no fault of their own.
</p>

<p>
Cults are depressingly common, but tend to be small and disorganised.
Generally, whoever is the biggest bully gets to be 'high priest', and
anything else depends on that person's ability to enforce their will.
</p>

<p>
It is said that the spirit of Meam enters those who venerate his name,
and who mark his symbol upon their bodies. It is definitely the case
that many followers of Meam are incredibly deranged, engaging in acts
of sadism and masochism, including murder, rape, self-mutilation, torture
and even cannibalism (to honour Meam's consumption of his own mother).
Many followers of Meam eventually degenerate into ghouls, though few
survive long enough.
