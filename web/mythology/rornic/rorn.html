<h1>Rorn, the Wanderer</h1>

<p>
Rorn the Wanderer was the moon god, who watched against
the coming of the Ice when men dwelt in the East. His
distraction from his task by a mortal woman led to the fall of
man, and his guilt led him to lead as many as he could
to safety, eventually bringing his followers to the
fertile lands of Tarvallah. 

He was a watcher, though beset by wander lust. He was
killed by Haltan in single combat.
