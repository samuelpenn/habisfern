<h1>The Druids</h1>

<p>
The Druids held absolute power in Weidany before the time the
Rornic people call the Betrayal. After this time, the Rornic
peoples migrated northwards, into Weidany, displacing the Weidanic
cultures which lived there. The power of the Druids was broken,
and now it onyl enjoys the same levels of power in Danuch.
</p>

<p>
The Druids base their worship around the Earth Mother Yammath,
who is a symbol of both death and creation. Much of their original
power came also from Elder magic.
