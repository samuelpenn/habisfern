<h1>Haltic Mythology</h1>

<p>
The people of the <a href="../../regions/northern.html">Northern Kingdoms</a>
follow a set of gods not entirely dissimilar to those of Rorn. The people are
of Rornic descent, though they split from modern day Rornic people well before
the Betrayal which devastated Tarvallah.
</p>

<p>
Their principal god is Haltic, equivalent to the Rornic Halta, though somewhat
bloodier in nature. Much of their mythology has come from the culture of Milindor,
which was a magocracy based in what is now the Hruul forest. It collapsed during
the 7th century, though vanished from the view of outsiders some time before this.
Though wizards were the ruling elite, they shared their power base to some
extent with some warrior cults of Haltan, who had a reputation far more like
those of Asabeth than the Haltan of Rornic myths.
</p>

<p>
Two gods, Vihri and Kugmar, came from the east, with Vihri borrowed from the
Belogan pantheon, and Kugmar from the Troll lands. The dragon god Fartha
(Farfthi) plays a far more prominent roll that he does in Rornic myths, and
is actually worshipped as a god. Again, this could be due to Belogan influence.
