Followers of the Cult believe that Ashek is the only god,
and all other gods are just one reflection of his disjoint
personality. They don't have a problem with people worshipping
other gods - they just believe that their way is the most
efficient.

<h1>Cult of Ashek</h1>

<p>
Ashek is the Mad God, the Insane Creator, who is the force
behind the entire universe. Ashek has many fragmented personalities,
which others worship as gods in their own right. The 'True' Ashek
though is the one taught by the cult.
</p>

<p>
Cult members believe that the only way to true understanding of Ashek
is through insanity. For this reason, they embrace the unstructured,
dangerous paths of magic which unhinge the mind, in an attempt to
get closer to their god.
