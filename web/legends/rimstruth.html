<h1>Rim's Truth</h1>

<p>
The set of items which include the sword <i>Rim's Truth</i> were made
by the magesmith <i>Dwynen of Aiden</i>, about 100 years ago. She was
a famous female warrior-smith, who made many other items.
</p>

<h3>Recent History</h3>

<p>
The last person to hold all three items was Cerodorn the Butcher, a
warrior-thegn who lived in Northwood during the previous century.
He was a infamous warrior, noted for his refusal to ever accept a
surrender. The shield, Strong Arm, was lost in the Troll Watch
while Cerodorn was hunting trolls. It has not been seen since, and is
believed destroyed.
</p>

<p>
On Ceredorn's death, the hauberk was passed to his son, Cadwallon,
and the sword passed to his nephew, the necromancer-warrior Halgorn.
Of Cadwallon, there is little to say. He died a peaceful death, and
the armour went to his son Madog, who is currently thegn at Abbyton.
</p>

<p>
The tale of Halgorn the Necromancer is somewhat more interesting.
He hired himself out as a mercenary to many men, and obtained for
himself an exceedingly good reputation. He took service with the
thegn Renbric of Rorn's Vale, and helped him in a blood feud against
a neighbour. When the work was done, Renbric refused to pay him,
since he was not a true warrior, and therefore not worthy of the
money. An argument ensued, and Renbric was slain.
</p>

<p>
Halgorn went on the
run, only to return when he was promised a trial which would favour
him. Not trusting him, Halgorn was immediately imprisoned and sentenced
to death on his return. He escaped however, and sought vengeance
against the family.
</p>

<p>
Raising an undead army, Halgorn layed waste to the family's lands,
but was defeated by Renbric's son, Guthred. Halgorn again escaped,
and later returned to finish the job by stealth, murdering the family
in their beds. The bodies of Guthred and his younger sister were
never found, and Halgorn was not seen again.
</p>

recently been found by a warrior-bard, Hengest.

Currently it is thought to be held by Madog of Abbyton, though it has
not been seen for many years, so it may have been passed on, or lost.
