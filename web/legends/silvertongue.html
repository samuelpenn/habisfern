<h1>Silver Tongue and Heart</h1>

<p>
A set consisting of a sword and shield, forged by the Mage Smith Gern of Teal
in 1182, for Renbric, Slayer of the White Wyrm. When they were first made, a
scabbard set with jewels was included, though this was not known to have any
special properties. It has since been lost.
</p>

<p>
Renbric was slain by the Necromancer Halgorn at Rorn's Vale. Halgorn was in
the employ of Renbric, but he betrayed him, and stole his money, later
returning with an undead army in order to wipe out evidence of his crimes.
Halgorn was initially defeated by Renbric's son, Guthred, but later the entire
family was murdered, and the bodies of Guthred and his sister Gute were stolen.
</p>

The sword was lost at the battle of Rorn's Vale, but was later found to have
fallen into the river, and was picked up by a warrior in the area some years
later.
