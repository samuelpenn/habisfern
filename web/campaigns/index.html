The campaign is based to some extent on Anglo-Saxon England, in
about the 10th and 11th centuries. It has a low level of
civilisation - stone buildings are rare, chain mail is the most
advanced type of armour, and the most common weapon is the
spear. The majority of people are unfree - serfs - while a
significant number are actually slaves. The main differences
are the presence of magic, and the lack of a single unifying
religion.

Magic is quite common in the world, and though it can be quite
powerful, it is slow and limited in what it can do. The main issue
is that use of magic will bring a wizard closer to the Otherworld,
making it harder for them to cope with the real world. Though this
increases their magical strength, it also causes others to view
them as insane.

The fyrd is the army which the Queen may raise from the ranks of

able bodied man in the Kingdom. The latter is rarely called upon,
and only during times of extreme emergency.

<h1>Introduction to the Campaign</h1>

<p>
The campaign is based in <em>the Kingdom of Rorn</em>, one
of the largest and most powerful of the various kingdoms in
this part of the world. About a thousand years ago, the
followers of the god Rorn were forced out of their promised
land in the south, and settled in the already populated lands
of Weidany. There was much fighing between the new settlers
and the old, but eventually the <em>People of Rorn</em> gained
control of the new land, and their kingdoms replaced the old
kingdoms.
</p>

<p>
Less than two hundred years ago, these kingdoms were finally
brought under the control of a single ruler, Aelthryth, Queen
of the Rornish People. Since that time, a queen has always
ruled this land.
</p>

<h2>Player Options</h2>

<p>
Though the Kingdom is not currently at war with anyone else,
internally there is bitter feuding between the noble houses,
and rebellions against the Queen. The latter are rare, though
there is always some intrigue going on in order to advance some
noble's plots towards further power.
</p>

<p>
The Kingdom is ruled by the Queen, who gives out power to thegns
and ealdormen. A thegn is a warrior noble who owes fyrd service
to the Queen, and in return has land and serfs to support him.
However, a thegn does not generally own the land they farm - it
is not theirs to farm out to others.
</p>

<p>
An ealdorman owns large amounts of land, and farms it out to
their own thegns. The most powerful ealdormen make up the rich
<a href="../society/houses.html">noble houses</a>.
</p>

<p>
A player may be a member of one of these noble houses. Being so
gives a person a number of influential friends in high places, but
it also brings with it a reputation - for good or bad - and a
countless number of enemies, both within other noble houses, and
from independant nobles who have a grudge against your house.
