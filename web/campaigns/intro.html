<H1>Introduction to the Campaign</H1>

<P>
The campaign is based in <EM>the Kingdom of Rorn</EM>, one of the largest and most powerful of the various kingdoms in this part of the world. About a thousand years ago, the followers of the god Rorn were forced out of their promised land in the south, and settled in the already populated lands of Weidany. There was much fighing between the new settlers and the old, but eventually the <EM>People of Rorn</EM> gained control of the new land, and their kingdoms replaced the old kingdoms.
</P>

<P>
Less than two hundred years ago, these kingdoms were finally brought under the control of a single ruler, Aelthryth, Queen of the Rornish People. Since that time, a queen has always ruled this land, and peace is more common than war.

<H2>The People</H2>

<P>
Estimates put the population of the kingdom at little more than a million people. The majority live in small villages and farms of about five hides (one hide being enough land to support a single family - the terms of hide and family are sometimes used interchangeably). There are a few towns of maybe a couple of thousand people living in them, but less than 10% of the population is urban.

</P>

<P>
A village is generally the holding of a <EM>thegn</EM>, a nobleman who owes fyrd (war) service to his Queen. As such, either he, or another man sworn to him (often a son) is well trained in warfare. Everyone else are generally farmers - a village of five families cannot support more than one of their own being a full time warrior. A thegn can have any amount of land, from a few hides up to several hundred (or more). Since the thegn must provide more warriors for a fyrd if he has more land (approximately one per five hides), the thegn will designate others to run the land for him, giving them the title of <EM>geneat</EM>, and requiring them to provide a warrior (often themselves) for the fyrd.
</P>

<P>
Likewise, most villages do not support their own craftsmen (though many will have someone who knows a little about such trades). Approximately, every <EM>hundred</EM> (a hundred hides) is officiated by a reeve, who is an official of the Queen, and collects taxes and fines, and acts as the court of law in her name. The manor of a reeve often supports craftsmen and sometimes a fort.
</P>

<P>
The title of thegn is not heridatory, and a thegn who has displeased the Queen can find themselves berift of rank and land on very short notice. Often, on the death of a thegn, the land will be granted to one of his sons (or whomever the thegn trained for the job), but this is not guaranteed. The title of reeve (and that of shire-reeve, who is the Queen's official for the entire shire) does not bring with it any land. It is rare though for a reeve not to be a thegn also.
</P>

<H2>The Gods</H2>

<P>
The gods are many and powerful, though rarely involve themselves in the matters of individual mortal men, save for those of a few heroes over the course of history. The most powerful of them is Yagma, the Earth Mother, who first brought forth life into the world from the frozen wastelands. Close to her in power, and the other god who stood with her at the dawn of time, is Rim, the god of the dead, who watches over the souls of those waiting to be reborn.
</P>

<P>
The other principle gods are Asabeth, goddess of war and revenge; Haltan, god of war and justice; Bis, god of fire and the sun; Fenya, goddess of the moon and women; Neya, goddess of peace, oaths and marriage and Estror, goddess of the dawn and spring.
</P>

<P>
The gods are served directly by their priests, who serve their gods in a peaceful role, being restricted from bearing arms. Their holy places are in all but a few places outside, commonly being groves or pools. Buildings are almost never constructed in the name of a god, though there is the notable exception of the Temple of Neya at Holbury, where the Queens of the Kingdom are crowned.
</P>

<P>
Though the stories tell of great battles between the gods, their followers rarely fight between themselves for the sake of their gods - few people venerate a god above all others, though many will have a patron god whom they favour.
</P>

<H3>Ashek</H3>

<P>
There is a new god in the kingdom, Ashek, who was brought to the land by invaders from Merkia almost two hundred years ago. The war with Merkia ended, with victory for the young Kingdom, and the truce was signed with the Cult of Ashek, not with the lords of Merkia. The Cult's influence is growing, and their ways are different to those of the native religion.
</P>

<P>
The Cult teaches that all gods are a facet of Ashek, that Ashek is the mind of the world, and all that is outside it. He is the god of knowledge, of magic, of insanity and madness. His priests keep many secrets to themselves, and build temples in his name. They are far more common in the West than they are elsewhere in the kingdom, though their influence is spreading. Some say that their aim is to displace all the other gods, though the Cult has never openly attacked any priests or beliefs of the old gods.
</P>

<H3>The Northern Cold</H3>

<P>
The god Rorn led his people to their promised land after their kingdoms had been crushed by the Ice. The Ice is a power more potent than the gods, which lurks with its minions in the dark lands of the North. After Rorn had been betrayed and killed by the other gods, his burning body was lain across the land, forcing the Ice back to its northern havens.
</P>

<P>
The Ice is a power in itself, a manisfestation of all that is inimicle to man. It is the final death (without reincarnation), the oppressor of passions. The gods are oppossed to its return, though some men work betray their own to work with it.
