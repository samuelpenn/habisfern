<h1>Tanwall</h1>

<p>
When men first came to the thick forests of Tanwall, they found
that there were already other, inhuman, beings living there.
Initially the most dangerous were the Troll Gods, though these
were practically wiped out within a few generations. Though an old
and powerful civilisation, they did not have the numbers necessary
to survive a prolonged war.
</p>

<p>
A more insiduous threat was from the animal powers that lived in the
forests between civilised lands. In time, men came to worship these
powers, giving sacrifices to them and praying to them as gods. Many
cults sprang up to worship them, and as their influence spread, so
did their power over mankind grow. Those that committed themselves
fully to the powers were gifted (or maybe cursed) with the shape of
beasts when they desired it. Warrior cults formed around the worship
of the animals, and over the course of generations membership of the
cults became the norm rather than the exception.
</p>

<p>
Distrust and fear met the early cultists, and war with those to the
east and west who had no understanding of the animal powers soon
followed. The cults in the far west were wiped out by the Brytish,
but a peace of sorts was reached, which was known as the Treaty of
Tanwall. This defined he borders between Bryteland and Tanwall,
giving the region both its name, and boundaries.
