<h1>Isle of Taneith</h1>

<p>
Inhabitants of the central parts of Euressa generally consider
that those people to the north and west of them are more barbaric
than themselves. Given that the Isle of Taneith lays beyond the
north western coast of Euressa, it is generally held that it is
an isle of barbarians.
</p>

<p>
From the point of view of the lands struggling towards feudalism,
with their well marked boundaries, written laws and organised
religions, the reality seems very much like the folk lore. Taneith
does have a civilised culture of its own however - it is just different.
</p>

<p>
Taneith is a land of tradition and heroes. Possibly the last of the
centres of fey power, it can be a dangerous and unforgiving land.
To those who know its customs and are aware of its dangers though,
it is a magical and enchanting isle, full of raw beauty and serenity.
