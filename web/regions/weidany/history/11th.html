<h1>The 11th Century</h1>


<h3>1001</h3>
<p>
With the gods with her, Queen Aelfthryth leads her fyrd against
Wilgar. Hwaetgar leads a smaller force against the shire of Talmoth,
and when the men of that place hear of this, they desert Wilgar to
protect their homelands.
</p>
<p>
On the last day of spring, the Queen leads a charge of heavy horse
and thunder against Wilgar, breaking his army utterly. Wilgar flees
back to Ornwold, evading punishment for his crimes.
</p>
<p>
The other leaders are killed, either in battle or by hanging. The
reeve of Talmoth shire is evades capture, but is found and killed
after a month.
</p>
<p>
The noble Hwaetgar is made ealdorman of Perrin and Westland.
</p>

<h3>1004</h3>
<p>
Trading ships from the south arrive in Ornwold, bringing words and
goods. Aelthryth orders the building of ships to explore south.
</p>
<p>
Freothflaed, mother of the Queen, dies.
</p>

<h3>1009</h3>
<p>
Wilgar corrupts the good men of Lanuch into turning against their
Queen, and with a small force takes control of much of that Shire.
</p>
<p>
The Queen goes against him, but many thegns are slow to provide a
fyrd to her, so she fights with fewer men than she had thought. Her
force is defeated by Wilgar that year, but she herself withdraws
unharmed.
</p>

<h3>1010</h3>
<p>
The Queen forms an army far from Lanuch, and marches against Wilgar
a second time. His army is hidden in fog, but Aelfthryth comes
against him unseen from behind, and his army is routed.
</p>
<p>
Three days later, the two armies fight again, and the Queen and Wilgar
fight together, and Wilgar is knocked from his horse, and speared to
the ground with three spears through his stomach, taking all night to
die.
</p>
<p>
The Queen then marches back and has killed those thegns who refused a
fyrd to her the previous year.
Many thegns are unhappy at this, and begin to stir to rebellion against
their Queen. Thegns fight against her for the next twenty years.
</p>

<h3>1029</h3>
<p>
The last rebellion is put down, and Aelfthryth Queen of the Rornish
summons all the nobles to her to make an Oath of allegiance to her.
They all do, and there is peace in the Kingdom.
</p>

<h3>1034</h3>
<p>
Merkia makes raids deep into Merrik. Has much magical might on its
side, and uses Brytelanders as mercenaries. Defenders arrive too
late, and the raiders go back after causing much destruction.
</p>
<p>
Each following year the same happens, and gradually the forts are
overrun, and Merkia pushes east.
</p>

<h3>1039</h3>
<p>
Aelfthryth, first Queen of the Rornish, dies by the sword of her first
daughter Aelflaed, not wanting to die in her bed. Aelflaed receives the
Kingdom.
</p>

<h3>1042</h3>
<p>
Queen Aelflaed moves to Stowell as Holbury is overrun by Merkians.
</p>

<h3>1047</h3>
<p>
The shires of Merrik, Angsly and Perrin fall to the Merkians, and the
Cult of Ashek. The Queen receives messengers from Scarondy, and an
alliance is made.
</p>

<h3>1049</h3>
<p>
In early spring, Aelflaed leads a massive force against the Merkians,
who come against her in great numbers themselves. Men of Scarondy
also move into Merkia, but later, such that the northern borders of
that realm are lightly defended.
</p>

<h3>1057</h3>
<p>
It was in this year, in Solmonath, that priests of the god Ashek came
to Stowell to speak to the Queen. For twelve days did they sit in
council, and in that time no attacks were made on our people by the
Merkians.
</p>
<p>
Then there was a day of clear skies and warm sun, though it was not
even the end of winter, and Queen Aelflaed comes out to her people to
declare that the Merkians had given up.
</p>
<p>
The Ealdormen of Merkia come to Stowell and swear allegiance to the
Queen, and swear an Oath to keep the Peace of Stowell to the priestesses
of Neya.
</p>
<p>
Some of those lands which Merkia took from the kingdom are given back,
the rest is ruled by the Ealdormen of Merkia under the name of the Queen.
</p>

<h3>1059</h3>
<p>
A great temple is begun in Stowell, for the priests of the god Ashek.
It is a large building, built all of stone.
</p>

<h3>1063</h3>
<p>
A price of 10 shillings is offered in Scarondy for the killing of any
druid by the Ealdorman there.
</p>

<h3>1092</h3>
<p>
There is fighting along the border of Cadwold, when the highland tribes
try to raid into the northern shires. A fyrd is risen against them, and
they are driven back. Many forts are built along that border.
