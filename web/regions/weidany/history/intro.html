The weather across the island is violent and unpredictable. Large
portions of the land are effectively uninhabitable due to the
hurricanes which blast away any attempts at agriculture or buildings
which people make in these regions. Those who live on the edge of
civilisation are often witness to spectacular thunder and lightning
storms which can rage for days.
</p>

<p class="sidebar">
The wizards that have control over the weather are in great demand.
Without them, life would be much, much harder. They ensure that
rain and sun occur at the right times for the crops, they drive
away frosts and ensure festival nights are dry and warm.

<h1>The Habisfern Scrolls</h1>

<p>
To the most glorious King Cerdic, Embryt, servant of Haltan
and your most humble advisor, presents to you this work which
I hope you find pleasing.
</p>

<p>
The island of Rorn is dedicated to our god who wisely led
his people away from the path of the Ice. The old cities
of man are gone, and we who are the descendants of those
people are all that are left of mankind.
</p>

<p>
The Isle of Rorn lays to the west of the Old World, and
was sheltered from the Ice buy the warm breath of the
summer gods. The Isle is split east from west buy a great
mountain chain, which cannot be passed except in the south
where it meets the sea. The northern reaches are still the
domain of the Ice, and cannot be passed by mortal men.
</p>

<p>
The isle is three thousand miles long from its east coast to
the west coast, and some two thousand miles wide, north to
south.
</p>

<p>
At its north western tip lays the smaller island of Taneith,
also known as the island of the goddess.
</p>

<p>
Much of the island is beset by great storms, which tear at the
land, ripping up any trees or plants which try to grow there.
Beyond the coastal waters, the seas are also storm tossed, and
quite impassable to boats which wish to travel out of sight of
dry land. The gods see fit to grant us our rituals which
control the storms over civilised lands, to bring rain at only
the right times, and to calm the winds which would otherwise
destroy our homes.
</p>
