<h1>The 10th Century</h1>


<h3>909</h3>
<p>
Ten ships land at Wercester from Bryteland, bringing many fighting
men. They burn their ships on the shore, and under the cover of fog,
raid coastal settlements. Except for a few small battles, the invaders
hide in the woods rather than fight.
</p>

<h3>912</h3>
<p>
The Brytelanders take the town of Hemmyford, keeping it intact but
killing half of the men there. They claim the town as their own, and
drive off Offa, King of Westland, when he assualts them there.
</p>
<p>
Offa, King of Westland, calls on aid from Centwine, King of Merrik,
promising land and marriages in return for aid against the Brytelanders.
Centwine leads an army against the raiders, and finally defeats them. The
few survivors are staked to the town walls.
</p>

<h3>945</h3>
<p>
From the Kingdom of Aidan comes a huge force of men and giants, which
takes back lands taken by the Kingdom of Lanuch. Many men of Lanuch are
slain by giants.
</p>

<h3>947</h3>
<p>
The men of Aidan takes the northeastern parts of Lanuch, and Anwynd,
King of that part of Lanuch, flees west to seek the protected of Wulfheard,
King of Western Lanuch. Wulfheard though has Anwynd hung.
</p>

<h3>953</h3>
<p>
There is a great battle between Aiden and Wulfheard in the summer, and
many of the men who follow Wulfheard die under the swords of giants.
At dusk, Wulfheard is slain, and his lands are claimed by Aidan, since
no other man of Lanuch is willing to fight the giants.
</p>
<p>
South Lanuch pays Aidan much money to stay away.
</p>

<h3>965</h3>
<p>
A great plague sweeps through the west of Danuch, leaving two people
dead out of every five. The Arch Druid declares the region to be cured
by the gods, and many of the survivors leave the region to take up lands
in the east.
</p>
<p>
When the plague has gone, the people of Sarondy move north to take the
deserted lands. As do the people of Bryteland, and the people of Tanwall.
</p>

<h3>974</h3>
<p>
Brihtric son of Cuthred son of Centwine King of Merrik wars against
Halfric son of Wulfstan King of Anglsy, after his marriage to Freothflaed,
daughter of Halfric, is refused. A battle is fought at Sunnedi Meadow,
with Brenrin, King of Perrin aiding against Brihtric. Halfric is slain,
and Brenrin flees with his men back into Perrin.
</p>
<p>
Brihtric marches to Ebsfield and takes Freothflaed back with him against
her will.
</p>

<h3>977</h3>
<p>
Brenrin sends invitation to Brihtric, asking him to attend him at his
hall to discuss their alliance. Brihtric comes in good faith, but is
murdered by Brenrin in such a cowardly manner that his own men desert
him.
</p>
<p>
Aethelwulf son of Brihtric leads his forces against Brenrin, who is
captured, and has him buried alive such that he has time to think upon
his crime before he dies. Aethelwulf goes to Holbury to ask for the
Kingship of the three Kingdoms from Neya, but is refused, and Neya
proclaims that no son of Brihtric's line may take the throne because
of his fathers breaking of the oaths of Neya.
</p>
<p>
The three Kingdoms are left without Kings for this year, but the Kingdom
of Aidan begins to march upon them, so the warriors of Merrik and Perrin
swear oath to follow Aethelwulf anyway, even though he is not king. He
leads them to the border, and fights off the men of Aidan.
</p>
<p>
The Kingdom of Talmoth allies with Aethelwulf for its own protection.
</p>
<p>
Aethelwulf returns to his fathers home in the Winter, and marries
Freothflaed, who persuades the Ealdormen of Angsly to follow him also.
</p>

<h3>978</h3>
<p>
Aidan sends a force into Perrin, which is met by Aethelwulf. The force
is defeated, but at great cost in men. Aethelwulf sends to Westland and
Ornwold for aid, as well as to Merkia. All but Merkia respond, sending
men in aid in return for the promise of lands to take as their own.
</p>
<p>
Aethelwulf marches northeast to Aberswych, where a great fort of a
thousand men is encamped. Sorcerers of Westland bring rains to muddy
the ground, and their bowmen cut down men in the fort, forcing them
out into the fleld in poor conditions. Their charge is broken, and the
fort is taken, but Aethelwulf retreats as reinforcements come near.
</p>
<p>
Freothflaed bears a son for Aethelwulf, who is named Cynric.
</p>

<h3>979</h3>
<p>
There is fighting all year along the border. Aethelwulf takes many
forts, and finally spends the winter in Aberswych, taking that place
a second time.
</p>
<p>
Forces of Aidan take the last of what was once Lanuch.
</p>

<h3>980</h3>
<p>
Riders of Talmoth push as far east as Estwed through the men of Aidan,
to ally with the men there. Aethelwulf's brother is killed in battle.
Aidan looses more than it gains this year.
</p>

<h3>981</h3>
<p>
Giants are seen again amongst the ranks of Aidan's forces. Aethelwulf
is injured and taken back to Holbury, where Freothflaed cares for him.
</p>

<h3>982</h3>
<p>
Freothflaed bears a daughter, who is named Aelfthryth. There is heavy
fighting along the border, the giants taking most of Perrin. In the
Winter, Cynric, son of Aethelwulf, dies.
</p>

<h3>983</h3>
<p>
Aethelwulf leads a great force against the enemy, with the help of much
sorcery, and pushes forward into Aidan. The King of Aidan is slain by
murder, and there is much confusion amongst his men about what to do.
The giants do not want to wait though, and turn on their allies. Corwin,
cousin to the King, is made King, and brings his forces under control.
By end of the year, Aethelwulf camps within sight of Chenfeld.
</p>

<h3>984</h3>
<p>
Aethelwulf sees no fighting this year. He marches on Chenfeld, which
surrenders without a fight. His forces go no further, and he returns to
his wife. Deserters from Aidan talk of fighting between men and giants.
The King of Cadwold allies to Aethelwulf.
</p>

<h3>985</h3>
<p>
Men loyal to Aethelwulf but not wanting a Queen to rule them try to kill
Freothflaed and Aelfthryth. The two are carried away by griffons to
Westland, and the men are hung. Aethelwulf arranges a Queen's guard out
of loyal warriors, to protect his wife and daughter.
</p>

<h3>986</h3>
<p>
There are border skirmishes against Merkia, and so forts are built along
the marches. Aethelwulf orders the same done against Aidan. There is
rebellion in Perrin against taxes, but they are put down. Aethelwulf is
slain in one of these fights.
</p>
<p>
Freothflaed moves to Holbury, and acts as regent for Aelfthryth.
</p>

<h3>988</h3>
<p>
Freothflaed orders raids to being against Aidan, burning their farm
lands before the harvest. There are few warriors to resist, and Aidan
pays Freothflaed twenty thousand pounds to stay away.
</p>

<h3>989</h3>
<p>
Aidan pays Freothflaed money again, and so on for the next three years.
</p>

<h3>993</h3>
<p>
Aidan goes to war against Freothflaed, being unable to pay again this
year. Its men are killed in battle, and towns and forts are burnt.
King Corwin of Aidan takes his own life.
</p>

<h3>994</h3>
<p>
Aelfthryth, daughter of Aethelwulf is made Queen of the Rornish People,
at Holbury at Mid Summer. She is but 12 years old, but has great insight
into the ways of men and ruling. She divides her lands into shires, and
appoints a reeve to govern each in her name.
</p>

<h3>995</h3>
<p>
Aelthryth who calls herself Queen passes laws which upset the rightful
noble families of the land. She gathers an army about her in fear of
their wrath. After mid summers celebrations, Aelthryth sleeps with many
of her guard, and disrgards the old customs, behaving not as a lady
of royal birth.
</p>

<h3>997</h3>
<p>
The ealdorman of Angsly,  Godwin Halfoot refuse to pass on taxes
Aelfthryth has unjustly claimed. The Queen raises a fyrd of two
hundred score men and marches against Godwin, beseiging his fort.
</p>
<p>
Godwin rides out against her at dawn, but his force is defeated, and
he is captured. The Queen has him hung, and confiscates his lands.
</p>

<h3>998</h3>
<p>
Aelfthryth gives birth to a bastard daughter, who is named Aelflaed.
</p>

<h3>999</h3>
<p>
The shires of Westland, Talmoth and Ornwold rally behind Wilgar, son
of Mergood, brother of Aethelwulf. They raise an army of ten thousand
men, and march on the shire of Perrin, where the shire-reeve Hwaetgar
stands against them at Hooksdale. Hwaetgar is defeated, and he is
captured. The rebels hold Perrin against the Queen for the rest of
the year.
</p>

<h3>1000</h3>
<p>
Hwaetgar is ransomed. The rebels are unable to organise their force
to move further against the rightful Queen, and many men, seeing the
wrongness of their actions, march back to their homes.
</p>
<p>
The Queen rallies support from those loyal to her and gets ready to put
down the rebels.
