The Scrolls were begun in the 687th year following the death
of Rorn. It was Embryt who worked out this date, for previously
all years had been counted according to the current local king.
For the first few centuries, Embryt's system of counting the
years was found only within the scrolls.
</p>
<p class="sidebar">
Gradually, it has come
to be used more commonly, though many people still prefer to
count the years from some local event.
</p>
<p class="sidebar">
Previous to 687, the dates have been pieced together, mostly
by word of mouth accounts. The further back one goes into the
past, the more likely that the dates, and even order of events,
are wrong.

Embryt wrote down the facts as he could ascertain them, and many
of his successors have tried to emulate this style. Over time,
several chroniclers have added their own biases into the writings
though, and it is sometimes difficult to tell the fact from the
personal views of the author.

<h1>The Habisfern Scrolls</h1>
<p>
The original scrolls were commissioned by King Cerdic of Lanuch,
in the later half of the 7th century. Since then, they have been
added to by further generations, even after the Kingdom of Lanuch
collapsed, and was engulfed by its neighbouring enemies.
</p>

<p>
The original scrolls are kept in the same place they have always
been kept, at Habisfern, in a stone temple dedicated to Haltan.
The priests who live here collect stories of events from across the
kingdom, compiling them into one single chronicle.
</p>

<p>
Several copies of the chronicles are made each year, and are
purchased by powerful nobles. To have a full copy is seen as
somewhat of status symbol. The priests welcome the 'donations'
made to them, and welcome it also because it ensures that the
knowledge they have worked out will not easily be lost to future
generations.
