<h1>The 7th Century</h1>


<h3>618</h3>
<p>
Aeddan, the King of Westland, is slain in battle, and the People of Rorn
take his lands as their own.
</p>

<h3>654</h3>
<p>
Oswulf, son of Centwine, King of Lanuch is killed in a battle against
warriors of Danuch. The Druids take many of his men as prisoners,
hanging them from trees and slicing open their stomachs. His
half-brother, Cerdic receives the kingdom, and leads many attacks on
the people of Danuch, in revenge for the massacre.
</p>

<h3>685</h3>
<p>
The Shield Alliance, led by Cerdic King of Lanuch,  meets the armies
of Danuch for the last time at Cadwold Hill. The Druids are beaten,
and all the land between the Scaedwin Forest and Tuffin Wood is claimed
by the Alliance. Seeing that they are beaten, the Druids order the
suicide of their followers, before claiming their own lives as well.
</p>

<p>
Many of the warriors of the Alliance stay to claim the lands as their
own.
</p>

<h3>687</h3>
<p>
In the 33rd year of his reign, Cerdic, brother of Oswulf, son of
Centwine, King of Lanuch gave to the priest Embryt of Haltan the
charge of recording the doings of the people of Lanuch, and to write
them down such that they become a true history for the grandsons of
the grandsons of the royal line.
</p>

<h3>690</h3>
<p>
Cerdic, King of Lanuch passes away, and his second son, Offot,
receives the Kingdom.
</p>

<h3>692</h3>
<p>
Offot, son of Cerdic, King of Lanuch, forces all chieftains within his
Kingdom to pay him tribute, finally stabilising the Kingdom. Most of
the troublesome chieftains had stayed in Southern Danuch to claim their
own lands after the Battle of Cadwold.
</p>

<h3>695</h3>
<p>
The Kingdoms of Perrin and Talmoth meet to agree an alliance against
Lanuch, fearing the power and greed of Offot.
