<h1>The 12th Century</h1>

<h3>1107</h3>
<p>
The thegn Hrulgar of Estwed, already more powerful than most, is
granted permission to expand east, to take lands from the short
folk there. He is granted ealdorman status over those lands. There
is unrest amongst the other thegns over this show of favouritism.
</p>

<h3>1132</h3>
<p>
The ealdormen of Merkia begin to build a road from Tanwall through
to Stowell, for much trade is beginning to flow between these two
places.
</p>

<h3>1148</h3>
<p>
Ten ships sail from Stowell, and land at the river Brent in Midlaen.
There is fighting with the people there, but a shire is set up in the
name of the Queen.
</p>

<h3>1161</h3>
<p>
There is an uprising of the Cult of Asabeth in Estwed, which tries
to reinstate one of its own, Anflaed, as Queen of Estwed. A force
marches to their forts, and routes their army and kills all that
they find.
</p>

<h3>1185</h3>
<p>
There is a plague in Lanuch, which does not spread. One in ten of
the people of Lanuch die.
</p>

<h3>1193</h3>
<p>
The shire of Midlaen claims freedom from the Queen. A force of ships
is sent across to them, but it is driven back by storms. A force of
men is sent across land, but they are driven off, and only a few
return.
</p>

<h3>1194</h3>
<p>
There are raiders from the north, from Bryteland, which fight against
the ships out of Stowell. The raiders which land fight a bit, and
then flee back to the sea before a large force can be brought against
them.
