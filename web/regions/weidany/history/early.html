The Scrolls were begun in the 687th year following the death
of Rorn. It was Embryt who worked out this date, for previously
all years had been counted according to the current local king.
For the first few centuriees, Embryt's system of counting the
years was found only within the scrolls.
</p>
<p class="sidebar">
Gradually, it has come
to be used more commonly, though many people still prefer to
count the years from some local event.
</p>
<p class="sidebar">
Previous to 687, the dates have been pieced together, mostly
by word of mouth accounts. The further back one goes into the
past, the more likely that the dates, and even order of events,
are wrong.

<b>Chronicler Bias</b>

<p class="sidebar">
Embryt wrote down the facts as he could ascertain them, and many
of his successors have tried to emulate this style. Over time,
several chroniclers have added their own biases into the writings
though, and it is sometimes difficult to tell the fact from the
personal views of the author.
