Feuds between the various houses are quite common, though most of
the time relationships are kept to the odd border skirmish or
political manouevering at court. It is not unheard of for one House
to send a small band of warriors half way across the Kingdom to
cause trouble on the lands of another.

<p class="sidebar">
A House consists of its Ealdorman, plus his relatives. Quite how close
a relative has to be tends to vary, and a favoured distant cousin can
sometimes be given higher status than a sibling or child. Generally,
anyone within two generations (descended from the ealdorman's grandfather)
will be considered a proper member of the House, and anyone within
four generations can be almost certain to claim membership. Geneaology is
measured always through the male side of the family.

<h1>The Noble Houses</h1>

<p>
Originally, Weidany was ruled by many Kings, whose kingdoms warred
with one another, until the weaker kingdoms were absorbed into the
stronger, and the current state of a single Kingdom was reached.
</p>

<p>
The blood lines of these old royal families still exist, and many
have a great deal of political power within the Kingdom. As before,
there are rivalries, alliances and outright hatred between these
lines. Today, they are known as the Noble Houses. Any ealdorman
(a noble with a thousand hides or more of hereditary lands) can
consider himself to be part of a noble House. Any noble related to
such a person within six generations can also consider themselves
to be part of that House.
</p>


<h2>House of Aeddan</h2>

<p>
This was once one of the most powerful of the Weidanic blood lines,
but now there are few who claim membership of it. It was magically
strong, and had connections to the Elder Races, but now owns little
land, and has even less political power.
</p>

<p>
Members of the House have a tradition of choosing Weidanic names,
rather than Rornic, though this isn't always observed.
</p>

<p>
It is allied with the House of Oswald, though this is thought more
to be for reasons of survival, than genuine friendship.
</p>

<p>
Ealdorman Uwain is lord of this House.
</p>


<h2>House of Aethlfryth</h2>

<p>
This is the House of the current royal family. Only females are ever
born to this House, and it is traditional for those who want a chance
at the throne to never take a husband.
</p>

<p>
Many of this family who are not close to the throne form the elite
royal guard, or join the priest hood of Neya.
</p>


<h2>House of Caewlin</h2>

<p>
Caewlin was the first of the Rornic kings of Weidany, and it was his
line that ruled the Kingdom of Lanuch before the rise of the House of
Aethlfryth. Perhaps because of this, there is a lot of enmity between
the two Houses, with the nobles of Lanuch desiring much greater
dominance than they currently have.
</p>


<h2>House of Cenic</h2>

<p>
This is the youngest of the Houses, formed only in 1207 when the thegn
Cenic was awarded land of the new shire of Cenicsdyke after its namesake
led several very successful campaigns against the invading short folk.
</p>

<p>
Since less than a generation has passed since its formation, there is
still a great deal of jockeying for power within the family ranks.
</p>


<h2>House of Eanwulf</h2>

<p>
The House was once the rulers of the Kingdom of Estwed, in the days
before the rise of the Cult of Asabeth in those lands. It has regained
some of its power and influence since those glory days, but not all.
</p>



<h2>House of Erwin</h2>

<p>
This is actually the parent House of House Aethlfryth. It is closely
allied with that House, and supports it in every way possible. This
loyalty has meant the House has amassed large amounts of lands around
its ancestral home lands of Merrick.
</p>



<h2>House of Gwern</h2>

<p>
The ancient blood line of this House once controlled most of Weidany,
naming itself the Kingdom of Aidan. It‘s attempts at further expansion
were halted by Aethelwulf, and later Aethlfryth. It‘s kingdom was
shattered, and the all principle members of its family were slain.
</p>

<p>
Today, the family barely constitutes a noble House, having a few lands
on the borders of the Kingdom in Aidan shire. The family is still bitter
about its defeat at the hands of the House of Aethlfryth, and is
generally considered treacherous, dishonourable and decadent.
</p>

<p>
For the past few generations, not a single member of the House capable
of influencing decisions has ever shown a hint of subtlety however.
</p>

<p>
The current head of the House, Ealdorman Caradoc, is halfway to
madness and spends much of his time with his harem of slave girls.
</p>


<h2>House of Hrulgar</h2>

<p>
In 1107, the thegn Hrulgar was granted large amounts of bookland in
the shires of Estwed, Eastmarch and Southwood, making Hrulgar an
Ealdorman, and forming the House of Hrulgar. The reasons for this were
entirely due to favouritism from the Queen, a fact which did not go
unnoticed by the other Houses, and the House is still despised to
this day.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, its members have always looked eastward, towards
expansion further into Nailand, rather than inward against the rival
Houses.
</p>


<h2>House of Merin</h2>

<p>
A minor House that is based in the shire of Talmoth. It is closely
allied with the House of Caewlin, though out of fear more than
anything else. It tries its best to take the most conservative decision,
to stay out of the notice of everyone.
</p>


<h2>House of Oswald</h2>

<p>
Most of the lands of this House are found in Angsly, around the old
Kingdom of Aeddan. This House has much magical might, and some rumours
say that it has ties to the House of Aeddan.
</p>

<p>
Its central family is quite secretive in its ambitions, goals and
actions, and tends to stay away from a lot of the political manoeuvring
in the royal court. The head of the House, Ealdorman Eadric is reputed
to be a wizard, as well as a capable warrior and noble.
</p>



<h2>House of Peada</h2>

<p>
The House of the old kings of Estwed, it is today fairly neutral in its
relationships with the royal House, and is more concerned with expanding
its domains eastward into Nailand.
</p>



<h2>House of Wihtgar</h2>

<p>
Once a powerful House whose kings were part of the Council of Kings.
It's lands were lost during the war with Merkia, and even the name of
its old kingdom - that of Perrin - no longer exists. Today it is a weak
house, dreaming of days gone by.
