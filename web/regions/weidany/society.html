<h1>Society</h1>

<p>
The society is pre-feudal across most of Rorn.
</p>

<h2>Those Who Rule</h2>

<p>
Her Majesty is the final arbitrator of law and justice within
the Kingdom, though except in cases which directly affect the
Crown, day to day cases of law are delegated to shire-reeves,
each of whom acts as the Queen's authority in one of the nineteen
shires of the Kingdom. In turn, the shire-reeves delegate to
reeves, each of whom oversee the carrying out of the Queen's
justice and authority for a hundred - about equivalent to a
dozen villages.
</p>

<p>
It is the job of the shire-reeves, and the reeves, to collect
fines and taxes, and to pass these on to the Queen (after taking
a small share of course). Though the reeves and shire-reeves
have total authority within their jurisdiction, their station
is not hereditary, and neither do they own any of the land they
oversee.
</p>

<p>
The protection of the land is entrusted to the thegns, who are
warriors and lords, and to whom the government of all other
aspects of the land is given. It is their duty to serve in the
fyrd during times of war, and to keep forts, roads and bridges
in good repair throughout the year.
</p>

<p>
In payment for these obligations, each thegn has right to the
produce and slaves of the land they are granted. However, as for
the reeves, the thegns do not own the land they govern, for it
is still the property of the Crown. Though the land will often
pass onto the chosen son of the thegn for purposes of convenience
on the thegn's death, it is not always the case, and the Queen
may pass it to any person she deems suitable if it is Her wish.
</p>

<h3>Ealdormen</h3>

<p>
Ideally, all of the land within the Kingdom is owned by the Queen,
and a thegn may have their lands (known as laenland) taken back at
whim. There are many nobles who resent this state of affairs,
and over time, through one means or another (normally as reward
for service above and beyond the call of duty), a thegn may be
granted bookland, which comes with a hereditary right of ownership.
</p>

<p>
Such land is outside the Queen's control, and the noble may do with
such land as he pleases. The rights of fines pass to the noble, not
the Queen, and so he often has his own reeves. He still owns
services to the Queen, and taxes, but such a noble has a great
deal more power.
</p>

<p>
A thegn who owns more than a hundred of bookland is known as an
ealdorman. The most powerful ealdormen form the <a href="houses.html">
great noble houses</a> of the Kingdom.
</p>

<h2>Those Who Toil</h2>


<h3>Freemen</h3>

<h4>Ceorls</h4>
<p>
The majority of the people in the Kingdom are freemen - ceorls
- who have been granted land by the Queen for their lifetime,
which they work for their own profit. In return for this, they
owe some obligations to the Queen - including fyrd service and
food rent (known as <i>feorm</i>).
</p>

<p>
Generally, a ceorl will not be called up to the fyrd except in
defence of his own shire, and few can afford to keep more than
a spear and shield for such use.
</p>

<p>
Though, technically, a ceorl owes nothing to anyone save the
Queen, this has been changing. For the most part, ceorls give
feorm to a local thegn.
</p>

<p>
A ceorl will be the head of his household, and farm a hide of
land.
</p>

<h4>Kotsetla</h4>

<p>
A kotsetla (or cottager) are barely free, and owe many obligations
to the local thegn in return for support. A kotsetla may have
five acres of land with which to support their family. They farm
their lords demesne, and are granted a share of the food from that
in order to make up the rest.
</p>

<h3>The Unfree</h3>

<p>
As well as the ceorl, there are the slaves, who have few rights of
their own, and are considered to be the property of a freeman
(either a ceorl, or more normally, a thegn). About 10% of the
population of the Kingdom is made up of slaves.
</p>

<p>
Slaves are not totally without rights, and the more extreme forms
of abuse by their owner are punishable by law. A slave may also
earn money, and own goods, eventually buying their own freedom if
they ever earn enough.
</p>

<h2>Those Who Pray</h2>

<p>
The gods of Weidany are many, and their demands of men can be a
burden. Man though is the creation of the gods, and is therefore
indebted to them. Further, without the gods, Man would have
succumbed to the Powers of the Ice long ago, with the results of
death, or servitude to it, far less preferable to anything the
gods of Summer could ever require.
</p>

<p>
Since the death of Rorn, the most powerful of the gods has been
Haltan, a warrior and law maker, who rules from his throne in the
sky realm from where he can see the entire world.
</p>

<p>
All priests pay him some respect, though in varying degrees of
reverence. Temples to him are places of rock and stone, often a
stone table upon which justice is carried out. To this end, the
local reeve often takes on the tasks required to serve Haltan.
</p>

<p>
Every village will have a priest of its own, who knows the lore
of the gods, and who can call upon them, or placate them, when
the need arises. Beyond the worship of Haltan, few of the priests
dedicate themselves to but one god, since all the gods have
influence on one part of a mans life or another.
</p>

<p>
Yagma is the mother of all things, and it is also she who guides
the spirits of the dead into the hands of Rim, the god of the
underworld where the spirits await reincarnation at a later time.
Ensuring that the bodies of the dead are properly buried, to ensure
easy transition of the spirit to the underworld, is one of the most
important tasks a priest must perform.
</p>

<p>
Estror is the goddess of the dawn, and must be properly thanked
on the birth of a child, or when seeds are sown at spring. Neya
is the Keeper of Oaths, whose vengeance against those that break
oaths given in her name - such as those of marriage - can be 
swift and terrible. There is a great temple devoted to Neya at
Stowell, next to the royal palace, where the priestesses seek
the protection of the royal line.
</p>


<h3>Ashek</h3>

<p>
During the winter at the start of 1057, peace was made with a
great northern force which was led by the priests of a god called
Ashek. The peace declared that the people of Ashek would become
part of the Kingdom, but that the priests would be allowed to set
up their own temples, and carry on the worship of their god.
</p>

<p>
The priests claim that Ashek is the one god, of whom all other
gods are a reflection. He is the Mad God, and his priests seek
greater understanding of him by delving into the arts of magic,
which can only lead to madness for a mortal mind.
</p>

<p>
Currently, two great stone temples have been built to Ashek
within the Kingdom - one at Stowell, the other at Cerdicsfield.
