Around the edges of the hills can be found several human villages,
the largest of which is Rorn's Vale. The central portions of the

The hills come under the authority of the hundred of Rorn's Vale,
though for the most part the law is considered unenforceable up
on the hills themselves. Unless something is causing trouble for
the villages nearby, anything up on the hills is left free to do
as it pleases.

<h1>The Cairn Hills</h1>

<p>
An introduction to this region can be found in the main text for
the Shire of Northwood.

<h2>Rorn's Vale</h2>

<p>
Rorn's Vale is a typical hundred town, with a population of about
four hundred.
</p>


<h2>The Cairns</h2>

<p>
Spread across the southern hills in a rough east - west line are
the cairns. There are about four dozen in all, though legend has
it that their true number cannot be accurately counted. There are
six major cairns, which each have extensive crypts beneath them.
The rest are single caves, or simple mounds containing no more than
one or two bodies.
