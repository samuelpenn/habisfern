Around the edges of the hills can be found several human villages,
the largest of which is Rorn's Vale. The central portions of the
hills have no permanent inhabitants, and is declared to be forest
land by the Queen.

The hills come under the authority of the hundred of Rorn's Vale,
though for the most part the law is considered unenforceable up
on the hills themselves. Unless something is causing trouble for
the villages nearby, anything up on the hills is left free to do
as it pleases.

One of the most common legends about the hills is that of the
Riders - warrior horsemen who, it is said, are doomed to ride
eternally, never setting foot on land. When the lands were
ruled by barbarians, there was a king called Enstig Longhair,
who ruled the lands around the Cairn Hills. Legend has it that
he married a woman of the otherlands, a fey beauty who spirited
him and his huscarls off to her home to live for eternity.
Every now and again, him and his men return to patrol their
original kingdom. If they ever set a foot on the earth, then
the years they have cheated will catch up with them, and
they will die.

<h1>The Cairn Hills</h1>

<p>
An introduction to this region can be found in the main text for
the Shire of Northwood.
</p>

<h2>Rorn's Vale</h2>

<p>
Rorn's Vale is a typical hundred town, with a population of about
four hundred. The thegn here, Berdun, is an old,
somewhat bitter man who now lives alone, the rest of his family
having either died or left him. His mood has infected much of
the village. The reeve is Jarn Hastikson, also a priest of Ashek.
</p>

<p>
Jarn is old, mad, and somewhat incoherent. During his saner
moments he can be very perceptive and crafty however. He is a
wizard, of quite a bit of power, though has forgotton almost
as much as he has learned, His specialities are men, animals
and weather.
</p>

<p>
The most respected member of the community is Jangi, daughter
of Jarn, though no-one knows her mother. She turned up thirty
years ago in Jarn's house, with Jarn claiming he was her
father. She is unmarried. She has black hair, green eyes and
very pale skin. When she was 12, she went missing for several
days, and when she was found she had tatoos across her chest,
left shouldre and back, and wouldn't say what had happened.
</p>

<h2>The Cairns</h2>

<p>
Spread across the southern hills in a rough east - west line are
the cairns. There are about four dozen in all, though legend has
it that their true number cannot be accurately counted. There are
six major cairns, which each have extensive crypts beneath them.
The rest are single caves, or simple mounds containing no more than
one or two bodies.
</p>

<h4>The Round Chamber</h4>

<p>
A tunnel goes directly into a steep hillside - getting to it
can be difficult. There is a large round chamber within,
with some smaller chambers off from the main one.
</p>

<h4>Ecbrit's Cairn</h4>

<p>
The Ecbrit in question was a recent thegn who had himself
buried here along with the other warriors. His tormented ghost
is often seen near to the site. It is a simple mound, but has
the most extensive tunnel system of any of the cairns.
</p>

<h4>The White Man</h4>

<p>
A chalk man with spear is carved into the top of this hill.
There is an entrance beneath the man's feet.
</p>

<h4>Stone Shield Hill</h4>

<p>
A mound fifteen metres long, six metres wide and some three metres tall. It's sides are riged with flat, circular stones, and there is a stone archway leading into a narrow chamber at the east end.
</p>

<h4>Corpse Hill</h4>

<p>
A very large artificial hill.
</p>

<h4>Four Barrows</h4>

<p>
Four barrows aligned facing towards each other.
</p>

<h2>Ashek's Tower</h2>

<p>
The strangest feature of the hills is that of Ashek's Tower.
It rises 25m above ground level as a steep hill, the top of
which opens into a rocky shaft which drops about 150m almost
straight down to a small, subterranean lake.
