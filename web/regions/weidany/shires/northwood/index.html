<h1>The Shire of Northwood</h1>

<p>
Until very recently, the region was covered entirely in thick woods.
The people of Weidany rarely dared to venture as far north, for
rumours and legends told of Elder horrors which were best left alone.
During the first and second century, the legendary hero of the Brytish
people, Bryte, was the first recorded human to travel these lands.
He forged his way northwards, but did not stop until he had reached
the less dangerous coasts of the north.
</p>

<p>
During the next few centuries, a few people migrated here, though
their names and lives go unremembered. What is known however, is
that by the 8th and 9th centuries, a sizable number of 'barbarians'
had made their homes here - mostly nomadic tribes. The occasional
skirmish, or bit of trading, with Merrik and Perrin make up the
majority of first hand accounts of these people. Collectively, the
region was known as Merkia, and the people the Merkians.
</p>

<h4>The Coming of the Prophet</h4>

<p>
Sometime during the 10th century, an event took place in the Cairn
Hills which changed the shape of Merkia forever. At a place now
called <a href="ashekstower.html">Ashek's Tower</a>,
</p>

<p>
1034
</p>

<p>
When Merkia was subsumed into the Kingdom of Rorn, the country was split into two shires, to bring it in line with the other shires of the Kingdom. The northern most shire was named Northwood, whilst the southern shire kept the original name of Merkia. Since that time, Northwood has grown considerably in population, though there are still large portions of it which are only lightly civilised. It also acts as a buffer against Bryteland, and its northern borders are the scene of sporadic warfare against the Kingdoms northern neighbours.
</p>

<p>
The three shires of Northwood, Merkia and Scarondy are probably
amongst the least civilised in the Kingdom. They all have large tracts
of heavily wooded countryside, little of which has been fully
explored, let alone developed and made safe. The fact that the region
was where the Elders made their last stand only helps in making the
regions outside of civilisation wild and dangerous places, sometimes
inhabited with things not quite human.
</p>

<h2>Geographical Features</h2>

<p>
Running from north to south through the middle parts of the shire is
a belt of semi-cleared farmland where 80% of the population lives.
This region is a mixture of light woodland, meadows and croplands.
Much of this land runs across a north-south bulge, which rises up
into the Tanwall hills once it gets as far north as Bryteland.
</p>

<p>
The shire's western border is the sea, though the thick woodlands which
run along the coast means that the majority of the population has
little or nothing to do with the sea. Except for a couple of routes
into Tealmouth and Whitebay, there is no easy access to the coast.
</p>

<p>
Stories which have come down from the original Merkian barbarians
tell that these woods were home to the Elder races, and were generally
off limit to humans. Various parts of these woods are still considered
to be haunted, though there has been little move to civilise the
coast.
</p>

<h3>The Veilwood</h3>

<p>
Covering the highlands between Northwood, Scarondy and Bryteland are
thickly wooded wild lands known as the Veilwood. It's name probably
comes from the almost permanent fog which layers the central portions
of the woods, making the entire place cold, damp and decidedly
eerie. Another possible factor in the choice of name could be from
the legends of the place, which mark it as being close to the
otherlands, and heavy in magic, ghosts and elves.
</p>

<p>
The most famous site in the entire woods is the Green City, a huge
ruin more than a league across. Most of it is hidden beneath the thick
undergrowth, though what can be seen is of a style which marks it as
being different from human architecture. Stone buildings merge almost
seamlessly into trees, and similar to Elder ruins, curves rather than
corners predominate. However, the two styles are different, and the
Green City was built for a more humanoid inhabitant.
</p>


<h3>The Troll Watch</h3>

<p>
Near the Teal Valley, straddling the border between Northwood and the
shire of Merrik, is the Troll Watch. For the most part this is simply
thick woodland, divided by many small rivers that feed the Teal.
</p>

<p>
The woods are so named though, because, it is said, you have to keep
a good watch out for trolls if you go through the area. Either that,
or the trolls are watching out for their next meal.
</p>

<p>
So far, no one has been able to clear the area of trolls, and it
still boasts the highest troll population outside of Bryteland.
The most common varieties to be found here are the hairy trolls,
though a number of deep trolls have been seen, especially deeper
into the woods.
</p>

<h3>The Cairn Hills</h3>

<p>
North of the Teal River, near the coast, is a region of hilly uplands
known as the Haerwen Hills. On the southern slopes can be found dozens
of stone cairns, ranging in size from a small one-body mound up to
thirty metre long stone topped burrows. It is here that was buried the 
barbarian kings. Many of the larger cairns are protected by magic,
and in some, the king's huscarls still defend their lord.
</p>

<p>
All these cairns are said to be haunted, though some are obviously
more so than others. Strictly speaking, the 'Cairn Hills' only
applies to the southern slopes, where the cairns can be found. However,
possibly due to the unnatural happenings witnessed in the whole
region, the term is sometimes applied more generally.
</p>

<p>
The single most notable feature of the region however is not found
amongst the cairns, but instead is to the northwest. Known as
Ashek's Tower, it is not known whether it is a natural formation.
A steeply sloping tower of earth covered rock rises about 25 metres
above the surrounding ground. At the top, is the entrance to a stone
chimney which drops over a hundred metres straight down. Somewhere
close to the bottom, a subterranean river empties out into a small
lake. The sides of the chimney are seemingly natural, with plenty of
ledges, caves and handholds for anyone who wants to climb down.
</p>

<p>
Branching off from the chimney though is a series of tunnels and
catacombs which are definitely not natural. Whether the chimney was
built by the same people who built the tunnels is not known, though
it is thought that the tunnels came much later.
</p>

<p>
According to legend, it was here that the god Ashek first spoke to
his followers. An old temple was built near the base of the tower
long ago, though it has long since fallen into disuse - at least by
those that still claim to be human. Madness and chaos seem to rule
the creatures that now live there, which ranges from ghouls, men,
ghosts and worse. It is said that Elder spirits infest the lower
tunnels, giving some order to the seeming chaos.
</p>

<h2>Politics</h2>

<p>
The shire is governed by the shire-reeve Earpwald Ricbertson, a fifty something man known for his tight fisted, money grabbing methods of shire management. Traditionally, the shire town has always been Erlwood, and Earpwald has not changed this.
