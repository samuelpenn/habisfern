There are two cultures within the Kingdom - the original Weidanic
culture, and the newer Rornic culture. There is not much difference
between the two, and the language is the same for everyone. There
are still two 'classes' of names though, the <a href="rornic_names.html">
Rornic</a> class, which is favoured by the nobility, and the
<a href="weidanic_names.html">Weidanic</a> class. Most people don't
care which culture their name came from.

<h1>Weidany - The Kingdom of Rorn</h1>

<p>
In 994, <em>Aelfthryth, daughter of Aethelwulf is made Queen of the
Rornish People, at Holbury at Mid Summer. She is but 12 years old,
but has great insight into the ways of men and ruling</em>.
</p>

<p>
So reads the Habisfern Scrolls, which detail the history of the
people of Weidany. She came to the throne despite much opposition,
for there were many who did not want a woman to lead them. Behind
her though was the priestesses of Neya, who were to come closely
bound to the Rornic royal family.
</p>

<p>
Aelfthryth was born into a time of blood feuds, civil war and
general chaos. The fact that she, and her successors were so
capable at bringing peace to the Kingdom was what convinced enough
nobles to follow her. Many of the gods, especially Neya and Haltan,
also backed the Queens, giving strength to her authority.
