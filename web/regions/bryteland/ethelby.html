<h1>Ethelby (Town)</h1>

<p>
Ethelby is a fort town with a population of just under three thousand,
which straddles the <i>Sonov&aacute;</i>. Eventually, this river flows
down to the coastal trade town of <i>Novborg</i>, so a lot of traffic
flows up and down stream.
</p>

<p>
The town has two parts - the inner fort (including a stone keep), and
the outer town. About two hundred people live within the inner fort,
with the rest (generally the poorer inhabitants) in the outer town.
</p>

<h2>The Royal Household</h2>

<h4>King Ethelred Haraldson</h4>

<p>
Ethelred is 42, a tall, blonde, thin man, though quick both of foot and mind, with
a keen sense of politics. He is not a particularly notable warrior, and
never was, and the other kings tend to see him as a merchant, rather than
a true warrior king. However, his battlefield strategy and tactics are
second to none, and though he himself does not fight, his warriors do with
and efficiency that puts off the other kings from mounting a land grab.
</p>

<h4>Bera, wife to Ethelred</h4>

<p>
Bera is a 40 year old woman, short and plump with strawberry blonde hair.
She is often cheerful, though has a violent temper at times, which is
normally aroused by others being incompetent in carrying out their duties.
She never gets violent, but her servents live in terror of her.
</p>

<p>
As far as anyone can tell, she loves her husband and children greatly, and
supports them in everything they do. Where there is a conflict of interest,
she supports her children over her husband.
</p>

<h4>Yngvar, eldest son</h4>

<p>
At 22, Yngvar is the eldest son of the family. He has the same strawberry
blond hair as his mother, and the height of his father. He is a competent
warrior, and disagrees with his father's attitude towards peace and trade.
</p>

<h4>Egil, second son</h4>

<p>
Egil is 19, strong as an ox, with dark blonde hair, taking more after
his grandfather Harald, than either of his parents. In attitudes he is
completely the opposite of his elder brother, favouring long term
tactics to direct confrontation. He's nowhere near as good as his father
at such things though. He is very good looking.
</p>

<h4>Arnvid, third son</h4>

<p>
A 14 year old boy, Arnvid looks like his mother. He is full of energy,
though liable to throwing violent temper tantrums when he doesn't get
his own way. Yngvar often torments him, which doesn't help matters.
</p>

<h4>Thurid, daughter</h4>

<p>
At age 9, Thurid is the youngest member of the family and the only
daughter. She is quite and shy, though curious. Currently, she has
long blonde hair.
</p>

<h3>Royal Advisors</h3>

<h4>Otin Thirdeye, Priest of Ashek</h4>

<p>
Otin is advisor to Ethelred, as well as being the head priest of
Ashek in the town. His name stems from his ability to seemingly
know what is going on behind him. He is somewhere in his fifties,
dark haired, with a wrinkled face and a birthmark on the left cheek.
