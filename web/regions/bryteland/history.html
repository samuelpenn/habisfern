<b>Settling of the North</b>

The north was settled sometime within the two hundred years of the death of
Rorn. Many stories of the Brytish claim that it was very soon after, if not
just before, the death of Rorn. Accounts from the northern peoples who were
here long before the Brytish however do not start mentioning them until about
two hundred years later. Possibly they arrived and did not make themselves
known outside the lands they settled, but given their nature, this seems
unlikely.

The great wizard Sorta is most famous for his use of Dragon magic in the
final battle against the Elders. Whether knowledge of Dragon magic was
common at that time in Bryteland is not known, but it has died out since
then. Currently, only the Waezgerat of Cadwold are known to have knowledge
of Dragon magic.

<h1>History of Bryteland</h1>

<p>
No written history has been kept by the Brytish, so the events of the past can
only be known through the stories of bards and folk tales.
</p>

<h2>The Migration</h2>

<h3>The War in Tarvallah</h3>

<p>
The people of Tarvallah existed more or less in peace with each other, until
around the time of the Betrayal. Some of the problems stemmed with the added
stress of the Eastlings settling in nearby lands. The priests of the Eastlings
stirred up trouble amongst the people, and civilisation decended into war.
</p>

<p>
The priests of Asabeth and Rorn turned on the followers of Voltan, and there
was bloody war. The warriors of Voltan assualted the holy places of Rorn and
burned them to the ground, making off with much gold and silver. As the people
fought, so did the gods, and the land became ill.
</p>

<h3>The March North</h3>

<p>
The king Bryte, who was a follow of Voltan, was instructed by his god to lead
his people northwards, away from the treachery of Asabeth and Tharos. They went
overland, fighting giants and the Elders who tried to stop the. Several great
battles were fought against them, and Bryta himself slew an Elder sorcerer. Most
of his own wizards were slain though before they managed to fight their way
through the lands still controlled by the powers of the Ice.
</p>

<p>
The last of Bryta's great wizards was Sorfa, who in the final battle against the
Elders changed himself into a Dragon, slaying hundreds of giants. He himself
was slain though before the end. However, his actions brought victory for Bryta
and the rest of the survivors. Bryta took the skull of Sorta-the-Dragon, and had
the rest of him buried at the site of the battle.
</p>

<h2>Founding a Kingdom</h2>

<p>
The survivors settled along the coastal lands which were the most hospitable
at the time. They built a great hall on a hill overlooking the mouth of a
river, formed out of ash, and the skull of Sora was mounted within it. The
place was blessed and dedicated to Voltan.
</p>

<p>
The region was not uninhabited at this time, though those that lived there were
few and disorganised. However, over the generations which followed,
both cultures merged.
</p>

<p>
Bryta ruled his new kingdom for a further twenty years, but come the time of
his death, he had not named a successor. Each of his three sons were capable
warriors and leaders, and each claimed the Kingdom for themselves. They
gathered their own followes together, and moved away to settle their own places.
Wars were fought, allegiances made and broken. The people spread out across
the land, fighting amongst themselves and with the barbarians here.
</p>

<p>
Over the next few hundred years, the region splits into dozens of small
Kingdoms, each bickering with the others. The various kingdoms merge
further with the old people of this place, until the two groups are
indistinguishable from each other.
</p>

<h3>Voltan and the Things</h3>

<p>
Many generations of warfare was not good for the people, and though there
were some short periods of peace, it never lasted long. Wishing for his
people to become strong, the Sky God Voltan comes amongst the people as
the king-priest Tostig Bluetooth. He goes amongst the jarls and persuades
them to come to a great council - a <i>Thing</i> - to discuss terms of
peace amongst themselves, and to elect the most powerful jarls to rule
over them.
</p>

<p>
The first of the Things is a success, and though no jarls are selected
to rule over the rest, alliances are forged and marriages are made, with
the promise of united kingdoms come the next generation. A second Thing is
held again after seven years, and a third after that.
</p>

<p>
The third Thing however, ends in bloodshed, as the cold grasp of the Ice
is felt amongst the nobles, and treachery and murder abound. No new
Things are held for a eneration, and so when a new threat arrives from the
south, there is no-one to stop the invasion and conquering of the people
by the southerner and his army.
</p>

<h2>Brytweider</h2>

<p>
The invader is Brytweider, who swars an oath to Voltan to accept that god
as his own, and to bring a single ruler to the land, if that god would
give him aid in the battles. His prayers are granted, and Brytweider
conquers the minor jarls within three winters, setting himself up as king,
with Voltan as his advisor.
</p>

<h2>The Troll Gods</h2>

<p>
The sons of Brytweider unite upon their father's death, with the
younger sons going out to conquer the far north. The next few
generations are a time of peace, though much is done to protect
the land from attack in the way of fortifications.
</p>

<p>
During the mid-5th century, the Brytish kingdoms were expanding northwards
into the thickly forested coastal regions. Having rid themselves of most
external human threats, the major enemy the Brytish faced were the trolls,
who were generally little more than large animals.
</p>

<p>
This view of trolls changed dramatically though when warband after warband
of Brytish warriors were wiped out by weapon using, and sometimes magic
using, trolls. The further north people went, the more organised the trolls
seemed to become. Eventually, a new breed of troll was discovered - the
<i>White Troll</i>, cunning and intelligent far beyond that of animals,
such creatures were organising their lesser brethren into formidable
armies.
</p>

<p>
Worshipped by the lesser trolls, these new trolls came to be known as the
Troll Gods. Individually they were very dangerous, but they were few in
number, so by the end of the 5th century , the last known Troll God is defeated,
and all the land up to the northern coast is inhabited by man.
