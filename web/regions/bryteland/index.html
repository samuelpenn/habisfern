The Kingdom of Rorn and Bryteland have been fighting a
centuries long war across their border. For the most part,
it is little more than an excuse for a fight, and it can
sometimes be quite friendly (as much as war can), though
occasionally it boils over in blood feuds. Rorn tends to
view the Brytish as thuggish barbarians, raiders and thieves.
The Brytish will happily agree with this viewpoint.

Tanwall and Bryteland do not have very good relations,
mostly because Bryteland is quite heavily influence by the
Cult of Ashek, and Ashek believes in total eradication of
followers of the Animal Powers.

The Brytish speak their own language, called Brytish. It
is very similar to Tannish, such that about half of that
language can be understood by someone who speaks Brytish,
and vice versa. A few words have root with old Rornic, but
not enough to matter.

<h1>Kingdoms of Bryteland</h1>

<p>
The north western coast was settled soon after the Betrayal by people
led by the Rornic king Bryta, who had sworn oaths to Voltan (Haltan) to
find a new land for his people, and to dedicate a place to him if such
a suitable land was found.
</p>

<p>
The place he found, on the northwest coast of the isle, became Bryteland.
</p>

<p>
The people of Bryteland are a mixture of Rornic and Tannish stock, and
their language borrows heavily from both, though it is much more similar
to modern day Tannish, than modern day Rornic.
</p>

<p>
Bryteland consists of (currently) five kingdoms. The relationship between
them is generally cool at best, openly hostile at worst. Cross-border
raiding is common, but then again intra-Kingdom raids are only slightly
less so between rival nobles.
</p>

<p>
The Kingdom of Rorn considers them barbarians, and indeed, the Brytish
are far more violent, with a somewhat simpler view of the world. They
have an extensive law system however. Their poetry at least equals
that of their southern neighbours, and reading and writing is reasonably
common, thanks in part to the influence of the cult of Ashek.
</p>

<h2>The Kingdoms</h2>

<h4>Harald</h4>

<p>
Harald is King of the south eastern Kingdom, which borders onto Rorn.
He is 18, violent and strong. When he isn't leading his men on a raid
to bash in someone's skull, he can actually be quite charming, though
these times are rare.
</p>

<p>
He was fostered with Osric Edgarson, and the two get on quite well,
though they have had no dealings with each other since they both
became king. He is cousin to Osric, and nephew to Edgar.
</p>

<p>
His kingdom has a lot of forts along the borders with Weidany and Tanwall.
He has about 3000 hides under his control, and can call on about 600
fully trained warriors when required. Personally, he has 30 huscarls who
act as his bodyguards and personal raiding party.
</p>

<h4>Edgar</h4>

<p>
Edgar's Kingdom covers the middle coastal regions.
</p>

<h4><a href="ethelby.html">Ethelred Haraldson</a></h4>

<p>
This is a landlocked kingdom which sits on the border with Tanwall.
Ethelred has been fighting border wars with Tanwall for the last
twenty years, though few battles have ever involved more than a dozen
men or so. He gains concessions from the other Kingdoms to aid in the
defence against Tanwall, however there are rumours that he is keeping
the fighting going, and making it sound worse than it is, in order to
keep the monatory donations flowing.
</p>

<p>
Ethelred is 42, a tall thin man, though quick both of foot and mind, with
a keen sense of politics.
</p>

<p>
A year ago, Harald stopped providing Ethelred with aid, and tensions
between the two kingdoms have started to rise.
</p>

<h4>Osric the Bastard</h4>

<p>
North-middle coast. 55.
</p>

<h4>Osric Edgarson</h4>

<p>
Forested northern portions. 24.
